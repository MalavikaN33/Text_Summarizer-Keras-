0,45,"Hyderabad-based drugmaker Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd on Wednesday said it had been served a securities class action lawsuit in the US for alleged violations of federal securities laws. The lawsuit, filed in the US district court of New Jersey, seeks damages to compensate investors for a purported decline in Dr Reddy's share price caused by alleged misstatements or omissions by the company. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) besides Indian exchanges. Further to our intimation dated August 28, 2017 with regard to US securities class action lawsuit, we would like to inform you that the US securities class action lawsuit has been served on the company in the US by the lead plaintiff, Dr Reddy's said a notice to BSE. In the notice, the company said it believes the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegation. In a class action lawsuit, one or several persons sue on behalf of a larger group, referred to as the class, if a dispute is common to all and the number of affected people is large. Shares of Dr Reddy's declined 0.53% to Rs2,276.05 at the close on BSE on Wednesday, a day the benchmark Sensex edged down 0.05% to 33,602.76 points. Dr Reddy's NYSE-listed shares had risen 0.45% to $35.69 as of 10.21am in New York. The suit has been filed on behalf of investors who purchased or acquired Dr Reddy's shares on the NYSE between 17 June 2015 and 10 August 2017. In this period, shares of the company plunged 42.76% on the NYSE to $30.33 apiece. A number of US law firms had in August called upon investors to move class action lawsuits on charges that the company had given misleading statements related to issues of manufacturing compliance at its Indian facilities. According to Vijay Pal Dalmia, senior litigator and partner at law firm Vaish Associates, Dr Reddy's could face serious financial implications. In this particular case there will be a collective liability towards the group of people who purchased the shares between particular dates. This is going to have serious financial consequences on the firm, Dalmia said. An analyst at securities house Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd said on condition of anonymity that it would be too early to guess a financial loss to the company, while conceding that it's a negative development sentimentally. The tight regulatory vigil by the US FDA has been a cause of concern for the pharmaceutical industry in India. There has been a spurt in negative observations by it recently. Dr Reddy's has constantly been at the receiving end of US FDA interventions. While the Miryalaguda plant was cleared by the US FDA earlier this year, the other two units are still under the scanner. On 6 November, Lupin Ltd received certain observations on its facilities in Goa and Aurangabad from the US drug regulator. The US FDA has also raised concerns about Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd's plant in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh, citing observations relating to violation of good manufacturing practices. The regulator had inspected the Baddi unit during 6-11 November.","Indian drugmaker Dr Reddy's Laboratories said it has been served a class action lawsuit in the US for alleged violation of federal securities laws.

1,70,"Patidar leader Hardik Patel on Wednesday rubbished the BJP's charge that he was a 'Congress agent' and said he was against the ruling party in the state as it had failed to create jobs and education opportunities for the youth. Speaking at the same venue from where Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani had addressed a section of Patidars on Tuesday, Hardik said the huge crowd showed who was more popular. Let us show our strength to Vijay Rupani in Rajkot and others in faraway Gandhinagar, he said. Rupani is contesting from Rajkot West assembly constituency and Hardik decided to hold his first rally at an urban centre in his constituency. This was also his last stop in the whirlwind tour of Patidar homeland rural Saurashtra, where he addressed four meetings during the day. Referring to his August, 2015 rally in Rajkot, Hardik recalled how the police had used force against the assembled Patels. He also asked people not to forget and forgive the BJP for committing atrocities on Patidars. In western Rajkot, the venue for the event, most of the posters of local Congress candidate Indranil Rajyaguru were replaced by Hardik's. Several local Congress leaders and Patidar youth wearing caps with the 'Jai Sardar' slogan came to receive the young leader, resulting in a traffic jam on the Nana Mauva Chowk. Bhavesh Patel, 24, explained the reason behind the enthusiasm. The Son of Sardar (Patidar) is coming, he said, referring to Hardik, who had led an agitation demanding reservation in jobs and admissions in educational institutions for his community. Hardik's Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) has accepted the 20% economically backward classes reservation for Patidars offered by the Congress. They say Hardik is Congress agent, Hardik is opposing the BJP. If my stand against this makes me anti-BJP, then I am, he said. Responding to Hardik, standing committee chairman at the BJP-ruled Rajkot Municipal Corporation, Pragnesh Patel, said the community knew the Congress was behind the Patidar leader's agitation. People will not get fooled,"" he said.

4,99,"At a time when Flipkart's valuation has been marked up by one of its investors Morgan Stanley, the Indian arm of global ecommerce behemoth Amazon has reported over 105% growth in revenue in FY17. As per filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Amazon Seller Services posted a 41% increase in earning to $485.4 Mn during the said period. Amazon Seller Services currently earns through commissions, advertisements and shipping fees. Recently, in the third week of November, Amazon India issued paid-up capital of $2.7 Bn towards its marketplace arm Amazon Seller Services, as per its regulatory filings. The Annual Returns filings include other line items. In addition to earnings from the marketplace and seller commissions, Amazon India currently generates revenue from its Seattle-headquartered parent by way of advertising fees, royalty on sales of Amazon's in-house brands like Kindle and other transactions. As per industry experts, the ecommerce giant's impressive growth can be attributed, in part, to demonetisation which was instituted in November 2016. Speaking on the matter, an online seller on Amazon requesting anonymity said, Last fiscal, the impact on Amazon was across categories -smartphones to electronics to apparel. These are the largest selling and fastest growing segments in e-commerce. According to some, however, Amazon's growth in sales slowed down considerably after the Indian government's Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) cautioned online marketplaces against deep discounting in April 2016. A report by Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research, for instance, states that the online sales of smartphones and other gadgets stagnated last fiscal after a three-year period of steady growth. Online smartphone sales increase merely by one percent to 32% in 2016, which the study ascribed to demonetisation, lower discounts and uniform pricing across online and offline platforms. Another factor that has contributed to the slowdown pertains to the new FDI guidelines issued by the DIPP last year. Formalised in March 2016, the stricter guidelines on ecommerce dictate: An ecommerce entity would not permit more than 25% of the sales effected through its marketplace from one vendor or their group companies. Ecommerce entities providing marketplace would not directly or indirectly influence the sale price of goods or services and shall maintain level playing field. Consequently, Amazon India's biggest seller Cloudtail stopped the sale of mobile phones on its platform in September 2016. Prior to that, smartphones contributed towards a significant portion of Cloudtail's revenues. As per the earning report posted recently, Cloudtail recorded a 24% jump in its revenue for FY17, showcasing a net revenue of $883.1 Mn. However, this is significantly less compared to the 300% surge to $712 Mn the vendor reported in FY16. Cloudtail currently competes with Flipkart's biggest vendor WS Retail, which posted a net revenue of $2.16 Bn in 2016. The financial report for FY17 has not yet been filed by Flipkart. Most recently, with the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in April 2017, Amazon India also had to suspend its invite-only Platinum Seller Program (PSP). While changing regulations are making it more difficult for ecommerce platforms to sustain business growth, Amazon remains focussed on its aim to capture the Indian market. To that end, the online marketplace recently doubled its authorized capital to $4.74 Bn, matching its earlier capital commitment of $5 Bn made in June last year. With the goal of getting ahead of rival Flipkart, the company is also doubling down on its efforts to diversify its business. On the one hand, it is getting ready to enter the online food retail and grocery market, while on the other hand, it is eyeing a piece of the Indian digital payments pie with Amazon Pay. The strategy seems to be working, given that it clocked over 105% growth in FY17.","Amazon on Wednesday said that it has more than doubled its business in Indian subsidiary, Amazon Seller Services, with over 105% growth in revenues in the year ended March.

5,42,"Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday hinted that tax rates under the goods and services tax (GST) could be rationalized to three slabs as revenues under the new indirect tax regime stabilize. Jaitley indicated the GST Council could consider merging the current slabs of 12% and 18% into one rate and reduce the number of items that are taxed under the highest slab of 28%. We started the rationalization ahead of schedule. We have thinned down the 28% bracket. Going ahead, we will rationalize it further to probably tax only luxury and demerit goods at 28%. We have to maintain revenue neutrality, Jaitley said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. You have 5%, then this 'X' rate after merging 12% and 18% and then the very thin slab of 28%. Eventually that will be the direction, Jaitley said, adding the speed of this rationalization will depend on how revenues pick up. Earlier this month, the GST Council brought down the number of items that are taxed under the 28% slab to 50 from 227, reducing the rate on items ranging from soaps and shampoos to tyre tubes. Besides, a cess is levied on some sin and luxury goods over and above the tax rate of 28%. Jaitley defended the government's decision to bring in multiple tax slabs at the beginning of the implementation of the tax on 1 July. In a highly differentiated society like India, we cannot have a single rate. The Congress party raised this in Parliament, asking for a single rate. GST removed barriers to trade in goods and services across states, subsuming a range of central, state and local taxes and unifying the country into a common market. But its implementation has confronted teething problems, prompting the GST council to make several revisions to address concerns raised by taxpayers. Jaitley pointed out that the government has been able to minimize the inflationary impact because of the multiple rate structure. By this process, we have been able to avoid the inflationary impact. The teething problems are transitional (and not necessarily because of the multiple rate structure, he said.","Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said GST Council could consider merging slabs of 12% and 18%, and cutting the number of items taxed at 28%.

IT department has given AAP a deadline of December 7 to explain the irregularities. Sources in the department told India Today the recovery notice was pertaining to the scrutiny of AAP's donations received in 2014-2015. The department found irregularities in the donations and has deemed it as taxable earnings by the party and not political donations. The party has been asked to to pay a penalty of Rs 30.67 crore. AAP sources said this was a vindictive move by the department under the behest of the Modi Government. They said this was the first time in the history of this country that a political party's donations have been treated as taxable earnings. The first notice for an explanation was sent by the department on November 17, but the party failed to furnish satisfactory answers.

7,61,"Former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi feels that one should not narrow down the meaning of patriotism by politicising bilateral cricketing relationship with Pakistan. The Indian government has not given any go-ahead to Indo-Pak bilateral series since the last one was held in India in 2012. Since then, India have played against Pakistan only in ICC events. Cricket is a platform to come closer, Bedi, whose penchant for plain speaking is legendary, told PTI during an interaction on the sidelines of an annual DDCA Conclave. Asked if patriotism in the current social scenario is intrinsically linked to being anti-Pakistan, one of the finest left-arm spinners of all time, said: This is not right. I am not talking anti-India if I am asking for a cricket series with Pakistan. One of the staunchest critics of BCCI, Bedi wants the word 'control' to be removed from 'Board of Control for Cricket in India' as it stinks of autocratic, dictatorial mindset. The national logo has to be worn by the Indian team and not the BCCI logo. I am very clear in my mind. The players are not playing for BCCI but are playing for India. New Zealand and Australia have national emblems. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh wear national emblems. Indian Cricket Board (ICB) or Cricket India should be the name, said the 71-year-old. Bedi also questioned the context of a series like the one India is currently playing against Sri Lanka, which is turning out to be a virtual no contest. We are just playing them time and again. We thrashed them in their backyard and now we are thrashing them here also. At least let's have some contest. Had this Sri Lanka tour not happened, the boys would have played Ranji Trophy.

8,66,"The income-tax department has issued a Rs 30-crore notice to the Aam Aadmi party (AAP) for allegedly violating norms on collecting donations, including hawala entries worth Rs 2 crore. The order for tax assessment issued this November 23 sought the party's explanation by December 7, saying it incorrectly disclosed hawala money as voluntary donations. The AAP said the order was bogus and accused the people who run the country of muzzling the voice of Delhi's ruling party. The reference was to the BJP-led government at the Centre, with whom the AAP has a running dispute over administrative control of Delhi. The income-tax department declared all donations to the AAP in 2014-2015 as illegal, revoking tax exemptions given to it as a political party. The order came with the penalty notice for allegedly concealing its correct income, news agency PTI reported. The party has also been charged with not correctly reporting political donations received by it as stipulated under the Representation of the People Act. Tax officials said the AAP was given 34 opportunities to explain its overseas donations, especially around Rs 13.16 crore it received from supporters from overseas before the 2015 Delhi elections. The party allegedly did not disclose before the Election Commission details of Rs 6.26 crore donated by 461 donors - each donation exceeding Rs 20,000 - during the election campaign. It has been alleged that details of donations worth Rs 36.95 crore were not uploaded online and the party did not declare Rs 29.13 crore in documents submitted to the poll panel. The AAP's total taxable income for 2014-2015 was Rs 68.44 crore, according to the tax notice. The corresponding income tax was pegged at Rs 30.67 crore. Delhi chief minister and AAP national convenor, Arvind Kejriwal, responded to the notice as a case of political vendetta. All these were accounted for and shown in books of accounts, Kejriwal said in a tweet. AAP treasurer Deepak Bajpai called it a malicious attempt to target the party, though each penny that we get is accounted for. Delhi BJP leader Vijender Gupta called the income tax notice a scathing but unequivocal indictment of AAP's duplicity and unethical behaviour.","As the Aam Aadmi Party was fined ₹30 crore over irregularities in overseas donations, the Income Tax Department has revealed that the party was given 34 opportunities to explain its stance.

While four deaths were reported in Tamil Nadu, four people were killed in Kerala. Sources said the strong winds uprooted several trees that fell on vehicles and houses, killing five people while two died after touching live wires in Thiruvananthapuram's Kattakada. Authorities said the toll was likely to go up as snapped communication networks had cut off several areas.

10,7,"Scallops may look like simple creatures, but the seafood delicacy has 200 eyes that function remarkably like a telescope, using living mirrors to focus light, researchers said Thursday. But scallops have concave mirrors at the back of their eyes. Scientists have known since the 1960s that Pecten scallops see by reflecting light off these concave mirrors onto the retina above, said the report in the journal Science. Some crustaceans and deep sea fish also have eyes like this. But now they have found a way to peer more deeply into these mirrors than ever before, by using a microscope that rapidly freezes samples so they do not get dehydrated and retain their shape. The result is first-ever view of a mosaic of tiny mirrors and crystals, carefully arranged inside scallops' small poppy seed-like eyes which line their outer edge, known as the mantle. Each mirror is layered, reflecting wavelengths of light in their habitat and giving them a spatial view of their surroundings. Each mirror is also tiled with a mosaic of square-shaped crystals, minimizing surface defects for a clearer picture, the Science report said. The mirror forms images on a double-layered retina, to separately image both peripheral and central fields of view. While it is still difficult to know what the world looks like to a scallop, researchers say this well-honed peripheral vision likely helps the scallop control and guide its movement while swimming, enabling it to assess which things around it are static or moving. The findings illustrate scallops' remarkable ability to grow their own complex visual system, and may pave the way for novel bio-inspired optical devices for imaging and sensing applications, the report said. The study was led by researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science and Lund University in Sweden. Explore further: New mirror reflects light differently than conventional mirrors.

The High Court also said that the press has to exercise care and caution while reporting about matters under investigation or pending trial, the Live Law reported. Every individual has a right to silence. He cannot be forced or compelled to speak on the issue, Justice Manmohan said. The court's order came on three different applications filed by Tharoor in his Rs 2 crore defamation suit against Goswami and the channel for allegedly making defamatory remarks against him while airing news relating to the mysterious death of his wife. Earlier in September, the Delhi High Court refrained from passing any interim order restraining Goswami and his news channel from airing any news or debate in connection with Pushkar's death case. Justice Manmohan had issued notice to Goswami and sought their responses on Tharoor's plea to restrain them from allegedly misreporting the contents of court proceedings related to Pushkar's death.

The Congress leader has alleged that after the last date of hearing on August 16, the journalist and his channel continued to indulge in misreporting and had broadcast an 8-hour programme on September 4 related to his wife's death. Sunanda Pushkar was found dead at a suite in a five star hotel in South Delhi on the night of January 17, 2014. Tharoor said the said channel's broadcast was a bid to establish itself. The media has very important role as a witness but the media doesn't have a role of being a prosecutor, a judge or an executioner. The Thiruvananthapuram MP said he had nothing to hide and had been fully cooperative with the police. Earlier this year, the head of All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) forensic department, Sudhir Gupta had confirmed that the death of Sunanda Pushkar Tharoor was unnatural and caused due to poisoning. We clearly said that this is a case of poisoning. This has been clearly stated in the opinion. This opinion has been made and formed on the basis of circumstantial evidence where certain drugs and poison have been recovered by Delhi police itself, Gupta told ANI.",The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to restrain journalist Arnab Goswami and his news channel Republic TV from airing news on Congress MP Shashi Tharoor's wife Sunanda Pushkar's death.

14,26,"India's GDP growth quickened to 6.3% in the September quarter, up from a three-year low of 5.7% in the June quarter, an indication that the Indian economy has shaken off the lingering effects of demonetisation last year and GST rollout on 1 July. Manufacturing activity accelerated due to restocking of warehouses by companies after temporary disruption caused by uncertainties surrounding implementation of goods and services tax (GST). While agriculture sector decelerated to 1.7% in September quarter from 2.3% in June quarter due to unfavourable kharif output, manufacturing sector grew at 7% against 1.2% during the same period. Mining output and electricity generation also grew faster than the first quarter at 5.5% and 7.6% respectively. However, most of the services sectors slowed down including the public expenditure which grew at 6% in second quarter against 9.5% in the first quarter. Finance minister Arun Jaitley said September quarter marks the reversal of the downward trend in economic growth. Additionally, this indicates that perhaps the impact of the two structural reforms-demonetisation and GST-is behind us and hopefully, we can look for an upward trajectory in the third and the fourth quarter, he added. Former finance minister P Chidambaram however said this a pause in the declining trend of economic growth. We cannot say now whether this will mark an upward trend in the growth rate. We should wait for the growth rates over the next 3-4 quarters before we can reach a definite conclusion. 6.3% is far below the promise of the Modi government and far below the potential of a well-managed Indian economy, he tweeted. While demonetisation of high-value currencies in November last year was expected to have disrupted supply chains in the informal economy, uncertainties emanating from GST implementation forced companies to cut down production and stocks, leading to a dip in manufacturing activity in the June quarter. Chief statistician of India TCA Anant said the reversal in manufacturing activity in September quarter is mostly to meet the additional demand for the festive season. Stock rebuilding by companies has not been completed. Next quarter GDP growth may also benefit from restocking, he added. Anant said the GDP estimation for the trade, hotel transport and communication services (9.9% in Q2 versus 11.1% in Q1) has been calculated using trend growth in past quarters which may have led to an underestimation. This could be revised upward as new data is made available, Anant said. Ranen Banerjee, Partner with PwC India, said the Indian economy is still experiencing slow down in the services sector such as finance, transport and hotels that grew at 5.7% in September quarter against 6.4% in the previous quarter. The possible causes could be the larger working capital requirements faced by services sector and teething process issues post GST implemention. We also possibly need to examine whether the three percentage point increase in tax rate on services to 18% under GST regime causing some demand side impacts. We will need to wait for thrid and fourth quarter GDP numbers to be able to comment on this more conclusively, he added. While growth in private consumption dipped to 6.5% in September quarter, investment demand growth picked up to 4.6% during the same quarter. Public expenditure which used to be the driver of economic growth in the previous quarters slowed down to 6% in September quarter. Data separately released by the Controller General of Accounts showed government exhausting 96% of its annual fiscal deficit target in first seven months of the fiscal year till October against 73% exhausted during the same period a year ago.

15,23,"In a bid to promote digital payments, the Indian Railways has said it will bring UPI payment system at all its ticket reservation counters across the country from Friday. We are going to roll out UPI-based payment system at all reservation counters across the country, railway board member (traffic) Mohammad Jamshed said in New Delhi. He said the system will currently be launched only for reserved tickets. He said over 97% of the tickets sold at Passenger Reservation System (PRS) counters daily are through cash and only two-three per cent of transactions at the reservation counters are through debit or credit cards. According to railway officials, 7.5 lakh tickets are booked daily. Now a passenger does not have to carry his credit/debit card, as they will be able to book it through BHIM app through a mobile phone, Jamshed said. He said the Railways is working to develop Bharat QR code option for booking tickets Once it's completed, passengers just need to scan the QR code to make payments, the official said.

16,36,"Former Union Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Thursday welcomed the improvement in GDP growth, however, he said that it is too early to say that the upward trend would continue for the rest of the financial year. Chidambaram added that the 6.3% growth in the GDP was far from what the Modi government had promised. India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the July-September quarter improved to 6.3 per cent from a year earlier. Chidambaram, who has been severely criticising the economic policies of the Modi government, said it was good to notice a 'pause' in the declining trend that the GDP witnessed in the last five months but added that the real picture would emerge in months to come. Happy that the July-Sep quarter has registered a growth rate of 6.3%. But we cannot say now whether this will mark an upward trend in the growth rate, Chidambaram said. We should wait for the growth rates over the next 3-4 quarters before we can reach a definite conclusion, he added. Earlier in the day, while responding Prime Minister Narendra Modi for criticising the Congress party after it demanded an 18-per cent cap on GST rates, saying whether the government's Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) was stupid for having a similar view. If it is Grand Stupid Thought to argue for a cap of the tax rate at 18%, then CEA Dr Arvind Subramanian and many other economists are stupid. Modi, who addressed four back-to-back election rallies in Gujarat on Wednesday, targeted Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on the Goods and Services Tax (GST). In a rebuttal to Gandhi's repeated criticism of the GST, a key economic reform undertaken by the NDA government, Modi said a recently emerged economist was propagating a grand stupid thought by suggesting a uniform GST rate of 18 per cent.","Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that improvement in GDP growth to 6.3% in the September quarter is ""a pause in the declining trend of the last five quarters"".

17,41,"As many as 800 million workers worldwide may lose their jobs to robots and automation by 2030, equivalent to more than a fifth of today's global labor force. That's according to a new report covering 46 nations and more than 800 occupations by the research arm of McKinsey & Co The consulting company said Wednesday that both developed and emerging countries will be impacted. Machine operators, fast-food workers and back-office employees are among those who will be most affected if automation spreads quickly through the workplace. Even if the rise of robots is less rapid, some 400 million workers could still find themselves displaced by automation and would need to find new jobs over the next 13 years, the McKinsey Global Institute study found. The good news for those displaced is that there will be jobs for them to transition into, although in many cases they're going to have to learn new skills to do the work. Those jobs will include health-care providers for aging populations, technology specialists and even gardeners, according to the report. We're all going to have to change and learn how to do new things over time, Michael Chui, a San Francisco-based partner at the institute, said in an interview.

19,16,"Just as the first leads showed the ruling BJP making early gains in the Uttar Pradesh civic election, party's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy tweeted that the BJP is riding the Ram temple wave, which will culminate with a typhoon in 2019, when the Lok Sabha elections will be held. UP local bodies elections BJP rides the Ram Mandir wave. I give as good as I get, reads his Twitter bio. BJP RAISES PITCH FOR RAM MANDIR. Ever since it came to power at the Centre in 2014, the BJP and its affiliates within what is known as the Sangh Parivar have been consistently raising the pitch for a Ram temple in Ayodhya, where a Mughal-era mosque was demolished by a Hindu mob on December 6, 1992. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which heads the Sangh, and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) claim the Babri mosque was built after destroying an original Ram temple. After it was demolished, the VHP raised a makeshift Ram temple there, saying it was where Lord Ram was born. Last week, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat raised the pitch for a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya, saying it will be constructed only at the disputed site and nothing else will be built there. It will be constructed and that too in its original form and with the same stones. It will be built under the leadership of those who led this movement and have been holding its flag for 20-25 years, he said at a three-day 'Dharam Sansad' of the VHP in Udupi. It was for the first time that an RSS chief had spoken so vehemently on the Ram temple issue in a public address. So far, the clamour for a temple in Ayodhya was largely a BJP and VHP plank. Next week, the Supreme Court will begin the final hearing on the cross-appeals filed against a 2010 judgement of the Allahabad High Court in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute. The high court had ruled a three-way division of the disputed 2.77 acre area at Ayodhya among the parties - the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara, and the Ram Lalla. However, in the run-up to the high-stakes Gujarat election, the Ram temple issue will continue to dominate headlines for now.","With BJP leading in the Uttar Pradesh municipal elections, BJP leader Subramanian Swamy on Friday tweeted, ""UP local bodies elections BJP rides the Ram Mandir wave.
