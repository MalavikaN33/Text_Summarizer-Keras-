1,HC refuses to stop Goswami from reporting on Pushkar's death,The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to restrain journalist Arnab Goswami and his news channel Republic TV from airing news on Congress MP Shashi Tharoor's wife Sunanda Pushkar's death. The court also asked Goswami and Republic TV to send an advance notice to Tharoor for his views before airing any news in connection with Pushkar's death case.,"The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to restrain journalist Arnab Goswami and his Republic TV from airing news about Congress MP Shashi Tharoor's wife Sunanda Pushkar's death case. The High Court also said that the press has to exercise care and caution while reporting about matters under investigation or pending trial, the Live Law reported. Every individual has a right to silence. He cannot be forced or compelled to speak on the issue, Justice Manmohan said. The court's order came on three different applications filed by Tharoor in his Rs 2 crore defamation suit against Goswami and the channel for allegedly making defamatory remarks against him while airing news relating to the mysterious death of his wife. Earlier in September, the Delhi High Court refrained from passing any interim order restraining Goswami and his news channel from airing any news or debate in connection with Pushkar's death case. Justice Manmohan had issued notice to Goswami and sought their responses on Tharoor's plea to restrain them from allegedly misreporting the contents of court proceedings related to Pushkar's death. It had also observed that the Congress leader has not shown any law by which investigation cannot be done by the journalist. Show me that after the first date of hearing, he (Goswami) has called you a murderer, the judge said, adding I cannot dictate what should be the editorial policy of a news channel. The Congress leader has alleged that after the last date of hearing on August 16, the journalist and his channel continued to indulge in misreporting and had broadcast an 8-hour programme on September 4 related to his wife's death. Sunanda Pushkar was found dead at a suite in a five star hotel in South Delhi on the night of January 17, 2014. Tharoor said the said channel's broadcast was a bid to establish itself. The media has very important role as a witness but the media doesn't have a role of being a prosecutor, a judge or an executioner. The Thiruvananthapuram MP said he had nothing to hide and had been fully cooperative with the police. Earlier this year, the head of All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) forensic department, Sudhir Gupta had confirmed that the death of Sunanda Pushkar Tharoor was unnatural and caused due to poisoning. We clearly said that this is a case of poisoning. This has been clearly stated in the opinion. This opinion has been made and formed on the basis of circumstantial evidence where certain drugs and poison have been recovered by Delhi police itself, Gupta told ANI.",https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/delhi-hc-refuses-to-restrain-arnab-goswami-republic-tv-from-airing-news-about-su/305034?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
2,Kohli responds to Miss World Manushi's question on cricket,"Miss World 2017 Manushi Chhillar praised Indian captain Virat Kohli, calling him an inspiration and asked him how he would give back to children in the field of cricket. Kohli replied, ""[W]hen you do what you do... it has to be genuine... Otherwise, people find out that you are trying to pretend and they can never connect to you.""","It's nearly been a decade since Virat Kohli made his international debut and if there's one thing he has been consistent at, it's his ability to score big run. While a number of records have been set and broken, his aggressive outlook has also injected a sense of belief in the side. While there are quite a few fans and followers who look up to him for inspiration, at an awards show recently, he met yet another youth icon who had a special question for the swashbuckling Indian skipper. It came from Manushi Chhillar, the newly crowned Miss World, who brought back the title to India after 17 years. The two shared the stage at the CNN-IBN Indian of the Year 2017 Awards night and Chhillar took up the opportunity to ask Kohli: You are one of the best batsman in the world today and you've been such an inspiration. You've really given back to the society. But there are a lot of young people who draw inspiration from you. The Indian cricket team skipper replied: Well, what's very important to understand is when you do what you do and you express yourself on the field, it has to be genuine and it has to be from the heart. Otherwise if people find out that you're trying to pretend, then they can never connect to you. I've never tried to be anyone else. I've always been myself; I always mention that people had a lot of issues with how I was, how I conducted myself, but I had never had any problems with that. Kohli had presented Chillar with a special achievement award as well. The moment I started to think that I need to change, is the only time I changed. Everyone has to go through a mutual process to be where they get to in life to become more mature. What's very important to understand is one should never lose their own identity, character and personality because if you try to be someone else you can never succeed, and you can never inspire others. The one thing that I believe in is that there's something much stronger that's making us do what we do. We ourselves don't have the ability to go out there, score runs and take wickets all the time. We must believe that everyone has a plan and that plan has been executed for them at the time they are in, and all they can do is work hard, no one can change the plan, what we can do is work hard and be honest with ourselves.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/virat-kohli-s-reply-to-manushi-chillar-s-question-is-taking-internet-by-storm/story-G84DRXkgD30XDbY7tK0RKN.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

Besides that, he waltzed around the bouncers and dodged around difficult questions, clarifying his political correctness at the beginning of the session. On Day 1 of HTLS 2017, founders of three Indian startups discussed their strategies as successful entrepreneurs. Their approaches: a sense of purpose, believing you are Superman, and the ability to juggle ticking time bombs. Speaking at HTLS 2017, finance minister Arun Jaitley said government spending on infrastructure and rural sectors will be the focus areas in next year's Union Budget as he ruled out privatisation of state-run banks. He also hinted that the GST council could consider merging slabs of 12% and 18% into one rate and cutting the number of items taxed at the highest slab of 28%. Cancer specialists Dr Ahutosh K Tewari and Dr Madhav Dhodapkar, at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, agreed that lifestyle changes play a major role in preventing the disease.

7,IIT-KGP researchers generate electricity from onion peels,IIT Kharagpur and South Korea-based researchers have developed biodegradable energy harvesters from onion skin waste. The nanogenerators based on piezoelectric effect convert mechanical energy to electrical and can generate power with body movements like tapping of fingers and throat vibrations. The team claims that electricity generated from six peels could charge a laptop or a mobile phone.,"Peeling onions have seldom been a loving task. But now, if you brave the teary eyes and chop some onions, the onion peels will reward you for your courage by producing electricity for your entire home! If this news gives you all the more reason to peel onions then you need to thank IIT Kharagpur for developing this path breaking green technology. The data generated by the researchers of the Material Science Centre (MSC) at IIT Kharagpur will not only encourage you to peel more onions but will encourage you to gather onion peels from places around you! As per research done by Prof Bhanu Bhusan Khatua and his team at MSC, only half an inch of onion peel can be enough to generate 20 volt of electricity! So, if you gather 6 such onion peels and place them in a series then together they can light-up 80 LED's or charge your laptop or mobile phone!",https://www.youtube.com/watch?utm_campaign=awesummly&time_continue=00&utm_source=awesummly&v=aTtlA2FBL7w
8,Scallops have 200 eyes that function like a telescope: Study,"Scallops, known as a seafood delicacy, can have up to 200 eyes that function like a telescope, using layered mirrors to focus light unlike most animal eyes which have lenses, an Israel-based study has revealed. Further, the mirrors tiled with square crystals, form images on a double-layered retina, to separately focus both peripheral and central fields of view, said researchers.","Scallops may look like simple creatures, but the seafood delicacy has 200 eyes that function remarkably like a telescope, using living mirrors to focus light, researchers said Thursday. But scallops have concave mirrors at the back of their eyes. Scientists have known since the 1960s that Pecten scallops see by reflecting light off these concave mirrors onto the retina above, said the report in the journal Science. Some crustaceans and deep sea fish also have eyes like this. But now they have found a way to peer more deeply into these mirrors than ever before, by using a microscope that rapidly freezes samples so they do not get dehydrated and retain their shape. The result is first-ever view of a mosaic of tiny mirrors and crystals, carefully arranged inside scallops' small poppy seed-like eyes which line their outer edge, known as the mantle. Each mirror is layered, reflecting wavelengths of light in their habitat and giving them a spatial view of their surroundings. Each mirror is also tiled with a mosaic of square-shaped crystals, minimizing surface defects for a clearer picture, the Science report said. The mirror forms images on a double-layered retina, to separately image both peripheral and central fields of view. While it is still difficult to know what the world looks like to a scallop, researchers say this well-honed peripheral vision likely helps the scallop control and guide its movement while swimming, enabling it to assess which things around it are static or moving. The findings illustrate scallops' remarkable ability to grow their own complex visual system, and may pave the way for novel bio-inspired optical devices for imaging and sensing applications, the report said. The study was led by researchers at Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science and Lund University in Sweden. Explore further: New mirror reflects light differently than conventional mirrors.

The security forces killed all the attackers after a gunfight which lasted for over an hour. Pakistani Taliban killed 134 children at Peshawar's Army Public School in 2014.,"Pakistani Taliban gunmen disguised in all-enveloping burqas stormed the campus of an agriculture college in Pakistan on Friday, killing at least nine people and wounding 35, police and hospital officials said. Police and army troops summoned to the scene killed all of the attackers at the Agriculture Training Institute in the northwestern city of Peshawar about two hours into the attack, the military's press wing said. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility, saying in a message from spokesman Mohammad Khorasani that they had targeted a safe house of the military's Inter-Services Intelligence agency. The gunmen arrived at the campus in an auto-rickshaw, disguised in the burqas worn by many women in the region, Peshawar police chief Tahir Khan said. They shot and wounded a guard before entering the campus. A wounded student, Ahteshan ul-Haq, told Reuters the university hostel usually houses nearly 400 students, but most had gone home for a long holiday weekend and only about 120 students remained. We were sleeping when we heard gunshots. I got up and within seconds everybody was running and shouting 'the Taliban have attacked', he said. Shehzad Akbar, medical director of Hayatabad Medical Complex, said six people died of their wounds and 18 were being treated. Another three people died at Khyber Teaching Hospital and 17 wounded were there, director Nekdad Afridi said. In December 2014, Pakistani Taliban gunmen killed 134 children at Peshawar's Army Public School, one of the single deadliest attacks in the country's history. The Pakistani Taliban are fighting to topple the government and install a strict interpretation of Islamic law. They are loosely allied with the Afghan Taliban insurgents who ruled most of Afghanistan until they were overthrown by US-backed military action in 2001.

10,Saudi Arabia intercepts second Yemeni missile in a month,"Saudi Arabia on Thursday intercepted a second ballistic missile fired towards it this month by Yemen's Houthi rebels. The missile was destroyed without causing any casualties, Saudi officials have said. Saudi Arabia has been leading a coalition of Gulf states against Houthi rebels who ousted the pro-Saudi, internationally-recognised government in Yemen in 2015.","A ballistic missile fired by Yemen's armed Houthi group at Saudi Arabia was shot down on Thursday near the south-western city of Khamis Mushait, the Saudi-owned al-Arabiya channel reported. It was the second ballistic missile fired from Yemen this month, after an earlier rocket was brought down near King Khaled Airport on the northern outskirts of the capital Riyadh. A Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen has closed air, land and sea access in a move it says is meant to stop a flow of Iranian arms to the Houthis, who control much of northern Yemen. The blockade has cut food imports to seven million people on the brink of famine. Air defense intercepted a ballistic missile, fired by the Houthis toward Khamis Mushait, Arabiya said on its Twitter account, without giving details. The Houthis and allied militias loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who have fired dozens of missiles into Saudi territory during a 2-1/2 year war, said on their official news agency they had launched a mid-range ballistic missile that hit its military target with high precision. SABA, quoting a military source, added the successful test was a new start of locally made missile launches. Saudi Arabia and its allies, who receive logistical and intelligence help from the United States, accuse the Houthis of being a proxy of Iran. The coalition has launched thousands of air strikes against the Houthis who still control much of Yemen's main population centers including the capital Sanaa and the strategic port and city of Hodeidah. The conflict has led to one of the world's worst humanitarian crises and killed at least 10,000 people.

11,Man fined for painting new road signs to make commute easier,"A Chinese man was fined 1,000 yuan (₹9,800) for painting new road signs. The 28-year-old told police, ""I saw that the straight lane was always packed with cars, while the lane that turns left has a lot of space. I thought changing the signs would make my commute smoother."" The traffic police said his actions could have caused an accident.","A Chinese man fed up with sitting in traffic during his daily bus commute came up with a brazen way of solving the problem - repainting the lines on the road. The man, identified only by his surname Cai, was seen in surveillance footage painting his own arrows at a junction in the eastern city of Lianyungang to redirect the traffic as cars manoeuvre past him, the regional Modern Express newspaper said. Police in Jiangsu province fined the 28-year-old 1,000 yuan ($150) after he was spotted crouching in the middle of the busy road with a can of white paint, according to the paper. I take the bus to go home after work every day, passing by that place, Cai said in what appears to be a police video obtained and published by the newspaper. The traffic jam there is always pretty bad but I saw there are only a few cars in the lane that turns left so I just want to expand one driving lane by adding one straight arrow. Authorities later ordered maintenance workers to remove Cai's handiwork from the road, but police released him after fining him. A policeman is heard telling him in the video.

13,Have slept in cars when there were no vanity vans: Salman,"Actor Salman Khan has revealed that he slept in cars at times when there were no vanity vans at shooting locations. ""I have been working 24 hours since the age of 15...and only worked all my life,"" he added. Salman further said, ""I live in a one-room apartment. It's a nice, hard-working man's life that I have led.""","It comes as a bit of a surprise when one of the country's biggest celluloid superstars says he leads a very boring life. That's Salman Khan for the uninitiated. In a free-wheeling conversation at the 15th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Khan said it was only journalists who made his life sound interesting. During the final session of Day 1 at the summit, the actor was at his witty best despite a sore throat. Everyone here must have led a better life than me. I have been working 24 hours since the age of 15. I have slept in cars because there were no vanity vans and only worked all my life, Khan said, downplaying his larger-than-life image. Ek baar maine commitment kar di, toh main apne aap ki bhi nahi sunta. It is about the commitments that I make. Like today, in spite of being ill, I am here because I had committed, Khan said. Dressed in a dark grey suit, Salman said that although he is 52, he is still as enthusiastic as he was earlier. When a member of the audience asked him about how he still manages to look young, the actor said: Mentally, I am still growing up; I would be about 27 now. Speaking about the Harvey Weinstein sexual harassment controversy that has rocked Hollywood, Khan said he did not know of any such cases in the Hindi film industry. I have been here for the longest time. Till date, I have never heard this. No one has come out and said it. Sometimes you push it so much that you feel it's easy. You think everyone is the same. I feel it's the most disgusting thing ever on this planet to exploit, to use someone to get them work. I hate it, said the actor, adding that would he ever come across such a case here, he would personally take the guilty to the cleaners. Asked about the Padmavati row, Khan said it isn't fair to hurt anyone's sentiments, but neither is it fair to comment without seeing the film. The Supreme Court and the censor board will make the correct decision and people should respect that. I have been doing it, said the actor, referring to his legal tangles. When asked if Padmavati's director Sanjay Leela Bhansali is capable of hurting anyone's sentiments, Khan joked, Bhansali has offended me. I gave him two hit films, and then he took Shah Rukh Khan in his next film. Khan ended the session on a philosophical note, taking a dig at himself, when asked about how he deals with failures. But in life, to deal with failure is difficult. I have the most amazing life, my parents are healthy, brothers and sisters are doing well and the fans love us. 99 per cent of the population of our country hasn't seen this kind of lifestyle and love and adulation.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/htls/htls-2017-i-live-a-boring-life-but-journalists-make-my-life-interesting-says-salman-khan/story-NG8kCddex8MacNjWJPg3gM.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

The app's aim is to reduce number of applications for queries under Right to Information act, as all data will be available on the system.","Within the next 15 days, you can find civic amenities such as underground pipelines network and nearby fire hydrants, sewage lines and land reservations on a mobile phone app. When developers take up construction work, they will be notified about the existing pipeline network to avoid damages. In addition to this, the details of the distance till pipelines will be available, which will helpful during trenching of roads. Civic officials said the system will help fire officials during emergencies as they can identify the nearest fire hydrants. We will introduce a mobile app wherein all the data will be available. Officials will have the information about the entire ward and the present status of civic amenities. Most of the data has been mapped by officials in the ward and we will just add it to the system soon, said an official. The BMC plans to upload data on the ongoing road work in the second phase of the project. Under the plan, officials will be able to see the entire details of every property and its pending arrears in property taxes. Reservation of land under the development plan too can be seen. A senior civic official said, The earmarking of the land will be according to the development plan for 1991 and 2014. Ward officials will be able to identify illegal constructions in their ward through the app. They will have to keep updating the system after routine visits. The aim is to reduce the number of applications for queries under Right to Information act, as all data will be available on the system.

The march will start at Yavatmal and conclude in Nagpur on December 12. ""The objective of the Halla Bol Padyatra is to expose the lies of the state government,"" NCP MP Supriya Sule said.","To up the ante against the state government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) is all set to kick off an 11-day march from December 1. The march called Halla Bol Padyatra will start from Yavatmal, a district in the Vidarbha region prone to farmer suicides, and conclude in Nagpur. Talking to reporters in Yavatmal on Thursday, NCP chief Sharad Pawar's daughter Supriya Sule criticised chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, alleging that he had betrayed people including farmers. The objective of the Halla Bol Padyatra is to expose the lies of the state government. Fadnavis made big promises to the people and farmers but betrayed them, said the NCP MP. Pawar will address a rally in Nagpur on December 12. It is likely to be attended by senior leaders from all opposition parties, including Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi. A few days ago, Pawar had declared that the NCP would not join hands with the BJP. This assumes significance as the NCP has been under criticism over its cordial relations with the saffron party. Senior NCP leaders were seen inviting ministers for their private functions, lauding and felicitating each other. The NCP chief is also known to be on good terms with the BJP top brass, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. All senior leaders of the party will participate in the rally that includes all its MPs, MLAs and MLCs. Sule and Dhananjay Munde, leader of opposition in the legislative council, will be part of the padyatra for 11 days. The MLAs will take a three-day break because of the MLC election on December 7 and will again join the protest, said a senior leader. We will have no vehicles for the padyatra except a state tranport bus-turned-ambulance with a stock of necessary things. The leaders are likely to cover 12 km in two sessions daily.

The decision was taken at its monthly standing committee meeting on Wednesday. Simultaneously, the corporation also announced that Saturdays at its schools will be books and bag-free. Instead, students will be shown short films on the life and times of iconic leaders like Bhagat Singh, Abdul Kalam Azad and Guru Nanak Dev. At least 2.5 lakh students are enrolled at the South MCD's schools, most of them from the lower economic strata of the city. The proposal for mounting murtis (idols) of goddess Saraswati, the deity of learning in Hindu scriptures, in SDMC schools was put forward by councillor from Hari Nagar, Anamika Mithilesh. She said, The children who come to our schools are poor and hence, often, lacking motivation for academics. If we install maa Saraswati's idols at the entrance, not just will these kids gain her blessings but feel more enthused towards studies. We can also have grand celebrations for Basant Panchami around the idol every January or Feb, she added. SDMC Standing Committee chairman, Bhupender Gupta, said, There are no additional funds required for this. The schools can arrange for these murtis from their own funds, so we have agreed to the proposal. Gupta added that every Saturday, students will not be required to bring their bags and books to schools.

Wait for the typhoon in 2019."" Meanwhile, the counting in all the districts of the state is on and the results are likely to be announced by Friday afternoon.","Just as the first leads showed the ruling BJP making early gains in the Uttar Pradesh civic election, party's Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy tweeted that the BJP is riding the Ram temple wave, which will culminate with a typhoon in 2019, when the Lok Sabha elections will be held. UP local bodies elections BJP rides the Ram Mandir wave. I give as good as I get, reads his Twitter bio. BJP RAISES PITCH FOR RAM MANDIR. Ever since it came to power at the Centre in 2014, the BJP and its affiliates within what is known as the Sangh Parivar have been consistently raising the pitch for a Ram temple in Ayodhya, where a Mughal-era mosque was demolished by a Hindu mob on December 6, 1992. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which heads the Sangh, and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) claim the Babri mosque was built after destroying an original Ram temple. After it was demolished, the VHP raised a makeshift Ram temple there, saying it was where Lord Ram was born. Last week, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat raised the pitch for a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya, saying it will be constructed only at the disputed site and nothing else will be built there. It will be constructed and that too in its original form and with the same stones. It will be built under the leadership of those who led this movement and have been holding its flag for 20-25 years, he said at a three-day 'Dharam Sansad' of the VHP in Udupi. It was for the first time that an RSS chief had spoken so vehemently on the Ram temple issue in a public address. So far, the clamour for a temple in Ayodhya was largely a BJP and VHP plank. Next week, the Supreme Court will begin the final hearing on the cross-appeals filed against a 2010 judgement of the Allahabad High Court in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute. The high court had ruled a three-way division of the disputed 2.77 acre area at Ayodhya among the parties - the Sunni Waqf Board, the Nirmohi Akhara, and the Ram Lalla. However, in the run-up to the high-stakes Gujarat election, the Ram temple issue will continue to dominate headlines for now.",http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/up-civic-election-2017-subramanian-swamy-bjp/1/1100961.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
18,Scientists designing golden nanopill for drug delivery,"US-based researchers are developing a microscopic gold pill that can navigate the bloodstream and be triggered to release drugs using laser light. The team demonstrated gold nanoparticle-coated liposomes, which are spherical sacs enclosing a watery core that can be used to carry drugs into desired tissues. After delivery, the nanoparticles can be excreted by the body via renal system.","Imagine a microscopic gold pill that could travel to a specific location in your body and deliver a drug just where it is needed. This is the promise of plasmonic nanovesicles. These minute capsules can navigate the bloodstream, and, when hit with a quick pulse of laser light, change shape to release their contents. It can then exit the body, leaving only the desired package. This on-demand, light-triggered drug release method could transform medicine, especially the treatment of cancer. Clinicians are beginning to test plasmonic nanovesicles on head and neck tumors. They can also help efforts to study the nervous system in real-time and provide insights into how the brain works. However, like many aspects of nanotechnology, the devil is in the details. Much remains unknown about the specific behavior of these nanoparticles - for instance, the wavelengths of light they respond to and how best to engineer them. They used the Stampede and Lonestar supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, as well as systems at the ROMEO Computing Center at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne and the San Diego Supercomputing Center to perform large-scale virtual experiments of light-struck vesicles. A lot of people make nanoparticles and observe them using electron microscopy, Qin said. The computations give us a unique angle to the problem. They provide an improved understanding of the fundamental interactions and insights so we can better design these particles for specific applications. Gold nanoparticles are one promising example of a plasmonic nanomaterial. Unlike normal substances, plasmonic nanoparticles have unusual scattering, absorbance, and coupling properties due to their geometries and electromagnetic characteristics. One consequence of this is that they interact strongly with light and can be heated by visible and ultraviolet light, even at a distance, leading to structural changes in the particles, from melting to expansion to fragmentation. Gold nanoparticle-coated liposomes-spherical sacs enclosing a watery core that can be used to carry drugs or other substances into the tissues-have been demonstrated as promising agents for light-induced content release. But these nanoparticles need to be able to clear the body through the renal system, which limits the size of the nanoparticles to less than few nanometers. Qin has turned his attention in recent years to the dynamics of clusters of small gold nanoparticles with liposome cores, and their applications in both diagnostic and therapeutic areas. If we put the nanoparticles around a nano-vesicle, we can use laser light to pop open the vesicle and release molecules of interests, he explained. We have the capability to assemble a different number of particles around a vesicle by coating the vesicle in a layer of very small particles. It's a quite interesting and complex problem. Simulations provide fundamental and practical insights. To gain insights into the ways plasmonic nanoparticles work and how they can be optimally designed, Qin and colleagues use computer simulation in addition to laboratory experiments. The coatings include several hundred individual gold particles, which behave collectively. It is very simple to simulate one particle. You can do it on an ordinary computer, but we're one of the first to looking into a complex vesicle, Randrianalisoa said. It is really exciting to observe how aggregates of nanoparticles surrounding the lipid core modify collectively the optical response of the system. The team used the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) computation method in order to make predictions of the optical absorption features of the gold-coated liposome systems. DDA allows one to compute the scattering of radiation by particles of arbitrary shape and organization. The method has the advantage of allowing the team to design new complex shapes and structures and to determine quantitatively what their optical absorption features will be. The researchers found that the gold nanoparticles that make up the outer surface have to be sufficiently close together, or even overlapping, to absorb sufficient light for the delivery system to be effective. They identified an intermediate range of optical conditions referred to as the black gold regime, where the tightly packed gold nanoparticles respond to light at all wavelengths, which can be highly useful for a range of applications. We'd like to develop particles that interact with light in the near-infrared range - with wavelengths of around 700 to 900 nanometers-so they have a deeper penetration into the tissue, Qin explained. They anticipate that this study will provide design guidelines for nano-engineers and will have a significant impact on the further development of complex plasmonic nanostructures and vesicles for biomedical applications. Inspired by recent developments in optogenetics, which uses light to control cells in living tissues, Qin and his team plan to use the technology to develop a versatile optically-triggered system to perform real-time studies of brain activity and behavior. He hopes the fast release feature of the new technique will provide sufficient speed to study neuronal communication in neuroscience research. There are a lot of opportunities for using computations to understand fundamental interactions and mechanisms that we can't measure, Qin said. That can feed back into our experimental research so we can better advance these different techniques to help people. Explore further: Nanoparticles could allow for faster, better medicine.

19,Maharashtra most-corrupt state for 3 years in a row,"Maharashtra has been the most corrupt state in India for three years in a row, as per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data. The state recorded 1,016 corruption cases in 2016, which is around 23% of the total corruption cases in India during the year. Odisha was placed second with 569 recorded corruption cases, while Kerala (430) was placed third.","Maharashtra has earned itself the dubious distinction of being the most corrupt state for the third year in a row. Of the total corruption cases in India, 22.9% were from Maharashtra. However, the only positive bit was that the cases declined from 1,279 in 2015 and 1,316 in 2014. On the crimes front, Delhi was the most unsafe among 19 major cities in the country, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of rapes reported, 33 per cent of crimes against women and the highest crime rate in 2016. Maharashtra was third among the states where most crime cases were registered in 2016. Maximum number of cases under offences affecting the human body was reported in Uttar Pradesh followed by Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, the NCRB report said. Maharashtra was second in crimes against foreigners, after Delhi. But, again the number had declined from 53 cases in 2015 and 59 in 2014. 'More corruption cases is a good sign' The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data put Maharashtra on top of the list of corruption cases (1,016) in 2016. The state is followed by Odisha (569), Kerala (430), Madhya Pradesh (402) and Rajasthan (387). Maharashtra was also the highest in corruption cases in 2014 (1,316 cases) and 2015 (1,279 cases) Experts say the numbers are reflective of the rise in awareness. The ACB has introduced a universal number to register complaints for the entire state - 1064. The number was promoted in both urban and rural areas. The numbers show the increasing level of confidence among people in the ACB, said Dixit, who was also the chief of the state ACB before becoming the state director general of police. Of the 1,016 cases, the ACB caught 985 people in 'trap' cases, in which government servants or his accomplices are caught accepting bribe. The other cases were disproportionate assets (17) and criminal misconduct/other corruption cases (14). ACB sources said consistent efforts are being taken to sensitise people to register a complaint whenever a bribe is sought, but many refrain from it owing the time-consuming procedures. This explains the figures in Mumbai, where people prefer giving money to get their job done, said the source. Other ranges cover a larger area. When it comes to rural pockets, people with low income level refuse to pay up, compared to those living in the city, he said.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-most-corrupt-delhi-tops-in-crimes-ncrb/story-vrGRJVsjzAHBHXJB7UmsaM.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

A search has also been launched to locate over 12 boats that had gone to the sea and are missing. Over 845 people have been evacuated from parts of Tamil Nadu's Kanyakumari district, where 16 houses were completely destroyed.","Heavy rains and gushing winds hammered the southern coast of Tamil Nadu and Kerala on Thursday as a deep depression in the Bay of Bengal turned into a cyclone named Ockhi, leaving behind a trail of destruction. While four deaths were reported in Tamil Nadu, four people were killed in Kerala. Sources said the strong winds uprooted several trees that fell on vehicles and houses, killing five people while two died after touching live wires in Thiruvananthapuram's Kattakada. Authorities said the toll was likely to go up as snapped communication networks had cut off several areas. At least 12 fishing boats set off to the seas from Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam coasts on Wednesday night are reported to be missing. Navy helicopters have begun search operations to locate the missing fishermen. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and army personnel are on standby as heavy rains and winds are expected to continue for the next 12 hours. Met department officials said the deep depression took a cyclonic proportion in the early hours of Thursday and centered around 185km north-west of Galle in Sri Lanka and 200km south-east of Kanyakumari. Moving towards Lakshadweep, the intensity of the cyclone will slow down after the landfall, they said. Named Ockhi - a contribution of Bangladesh - the cyclone can generate winds between 100-160 kmph when it hits the land. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has called an emergency cabinet meeting to take stock of the situation. The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority has asked civic bodies to be ready for rescue operations. Kerala police chief Loknath Behra said cops had started evacuating people from low-lying areas. Railways have cancelled at least 12 trains and educational institutions have been asked to shut down in three districts of south Kerala. Heavy rains also triggered landslides in several high-range areas.

21,PM Modi pauses election rally speech during Azaan in Gujarat,"PM Narendra Modi on Thursday paused halfway through his election rally speech in Gujarat's Navsari district, waiting for the Azaan from a nearby mosque to complete before continuing. PM Modi had also paused his speech until the Azaan was over while campaigning for the BJP in West Bengal's Kharagpur in March 2016.","Politics may make people do things that they would not normally do. Politicians sometimes go to the extreme in an effort to stay in power and while sometimes they succeed in that attempt, they also fail a lot of times. Prime Minister Modi's campaign in Gujarat is a clear example of political opportunism, where Modi, who was being projected as the saviour of Hindus, is fighting tooth and nail with the Congress to gain the approval of Muslims in his home state. Aghai said that Modi is the leader of all 125 crore Indians, but the majority Hindu population of India, especially North India, is trying to project him as a leader of only Hindus who will remove Muslims from India and make 'Hindustan' a land of only Hindus. At this time, when Modi pauses his speech for the Azaan, he is trying to send a signal to the Gujarat Muslims that he is secular and accords the same respect to all religions. However, at the same time, Modi's BJP is trying to differentiate between Hindus and Muslims in Gujarat. Aghai said that although the Congress has issued a clarification that Rahul was indeed a Hindu, it was hard to understand why such petty issues like a leader's religion were being made so important by the BJP. If Rahul Gandhi was a Muslim, would that make him ineligible for contesting the elections, he asked. Talking to India Today, a local Muslim intellectual and senior citizen said that if Modi has decided to come back to the land of secularism, he is more than welcome. Those who wanted a separate country in the name of their religion left India for good in 1947 and those who remained here, were all secular-minded people. If now, attempts are being made to create a rift between the Hindus and Muslims by some right-wing elements, Modi's change of heart will go a long way towards dissuading such forces.",http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/narendra-modi-gujarat-assembly-polls-muslims-navsari/1/1100607.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
22,"Doklam our territory, will decide on troops in region: China","China's military on Thursday said that the disputed Doklam region is ""Chinese territory"" and it will decide on the deployment of troops in the region on its own. This comes amid reports that China is maintaining a sizeable number of troops close to Doklam. India and China engaged in a 73-day-long military standoff in Doklam in June over sovereignty concerns.","The Chinese military on Thursday hinted at maintaining sizable presence of its troops near the area of Doklam standoff during winter, asserting that the region is in Chinese territory. India and China resolved the 73-day tense standoff on August 28 at Doklam area after the People's Liberation Army (PLA) stopped building a strategic road close to India's narrow Chicken Neck area connecting to North-Eastern states. Bhutan also claims the Doklam area to be its part. India objected to the road building by the PLA, saying that it endangered the security of the narrow corridor. According to official accounts, both China and India in the past used to withdraw troops from the advanced regions of that area during the winter which is harsh. Donglong (Doklam) is Chinese territory, Col Wu Qian, spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Defence said today when asked about reports that PLA continue to maintain sizable number of troops close to the Doklam standoff area and doing away with the practice of vacating the place during winter. Based on this principle we will decide on the deployment of troops on our own, he said without elaborating. The continued presence of Chinese troops near Yatung close to Doklam reportedly prompted India too to maintain its troops presence there. It was the first meeting after the Doklam standoff. Asked whether the two sides made progress to establish hotlines between the two militaries to avert crisis like Doklam, Wu said both sides are in touch on this issue. He, however, clarified that the hotline can't be between the two military headquarters as China no longer has a military central office after the recent reforms. At the WMCC meeting, the two sides discussed maintaining peace and stability and border exchanges, Wu said, adding that both sides will keep in contact with each other.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hints-at-maintaining-sizable-troops-presence-near-doklam-in-winter/story-cF1MQHOoh00RaaerjKH93K.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

We expect that the prime minister and the BJP will find time to answer the questions posed to them by Rahul Gandhi, he said. Deepinder Hooda also accused the BJP of working for the super-rich and middlemen, alleging that the party's economic policy was at the cost of the poor.

Unable to bear the stink emanating from his socks, the fellow passengers asked the youth to either put them in his bag or throw out. Kumar, however, refused to do either, resulting in a heated exchange between him and other passengers. The driver and conductor stopped twice or thrice to resolve the issue and asked Kumar to throw the socks but he refused to budge.

27,India's GDP growth surges to 6.3% in September quarter,"India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rebound to 6.3% in September quarter from a three-year low of 5.7% in the June quarter, government data showed on Thursday. However, the pace of growth is still below 7.5% recorded in the corresponding quarter a year ago. Further, the economy grew at 6.1% in Gross Value Added (GVA) terms.","India's GDP growth quickened to 6.3% in the September quarter, up from a three-year low of 5.7% in the June quarter, an indication that the Indian economy has shaken off the lingering effects of demonetisation last year and GST rollout on 1 July. Manufacturing activity accelerated due to restocking of warehouses by companies after temporary disruption caused by uncertainties surrounding implementation of goods and services tax (GST). While agriculture sector decelerated to 1.7% in September quarter from 2.3% in June quarter due to unfavourable kharif output, manufacturing sector grew at 7% against 1.2% during the same period. Mining output and electricity generation also grew faster than the first quarter at 5.5% and 7.6% respectively. However, most of the services sectors slowed down including the public expenditure which grew at 6% in second quarter against 9.5% in the first quarter. Finance minister Arun Jaitley said September quarter marks the reversal of the downward trend in economic growth. Additionally, this indicates that perhaps the impact of the two structural reforms-demonetisation and GST-is behind us and hopefully, we can look for an upward trajectory in the third and the fourth quarter, he added. Former finance minister P Chidambaram however said this a pause in the declining trend of economic growth. We cannot say now whether this will mark an upward trend in the growth rate. We should wait for the growth rates over the next 3-4 quarters before we can reach a definite conclusion. 6.3% is far below the promise of the Modi government and far below the potential of a well-managed Indian economy, he tweeted. While demonetisation of high-value currencies in November last year was expected to have disrupted supply chains in the informal economy, uncertainties emanating from GST implementation forced companies to cut down production and stocks, leading to a dip in manufacturing activity in the June quarter. Chief statistician of India TCA Anant said the reversal in manufacturing activity in September quarter is mostly to meet the additional demand for the festive season. Stock rebuilding by companies has not been completed. Next quarter GDP growth may also benefit from restocking, he added. Anant said the GDP estimation for the trade, hotel transport and communication services (9.9% in Q2 versus 11.1% in Q1) has been calculated using trend growth in past quarters which may have led to an underestimation. This could be revised upward as new data is made available, Anant said. Ranen Banerjee, Partner with PwC India, said the Indian economy is still experiencing slow down in the services sector such as finance, transport and hotels that grew at 5.7% in September quarter against 6.4% in the previous quarter. The possible causes could be the larger working capital requirements faced by services sector and teething process issues post GST implemention. We also possibly need to examine whether the three percentage point increase in tax rate on services to 18% under GST regime causing some demand side impacts. We will need to wait for thrid and fourth quarter GDP numbers to be able to comment on this more conclusively, he added. While growth in private consumption dipped to 6.5% in September quarter, investment demand growth picked up to 4.6% during the same quarter. Public expenditure which used to be the driver of economic growth in the previous quarters slowed down to 6% in September quarter. Data separately released by the Controller General of Accounts showed government exhausting 96% of its annual fiscal deficit target in first seven months of the fiscal year till October against 73% exhausted during the same period a year ago.

28,"Bitcoin hits $11,000 just 12 hours after reaching $10,000","The world's largest digital currency Bitcoin spiked through the $11,000 mark on Wednesday just about 12 hours after it crossed $10,000. The value of all the Bitcoins in circulation has now surpassed $190 billion after the price of Bitcoin hit a fresh high of over $11,370. The second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum also hit a new lifetime high of $520.","Bitcoin surpassed $11,000 in a matter of hours after hitting the $10,000 milestone, taking this year's price surge to almost 12-fold as buyers shrugged off increased warnings that the largest digital currency is an asset bubble. The euphoria is bringing to the mainstream what was once considered the provenance of computer developers, futurists and libertarians seeking to create an alternative to central bank-controlled monetary systems. While the actual volume of transactions conducted in cryptocurrencies is relatively small, the optimism surrounding the technology continues to drive it to new highs. Some on Wall Street are embracing the run, with more than 100 hedge funds now dedicated to digital currencies. Others are issuing dire warnings, with Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz saying it ought to be outlawed as it doesn't serve any socially useful function. Bitcoin has risen by about 75% since October alone, after developers agreed to cancel a technology update that threatened to split the digital currency. Even as analysts disagree on whether the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is truly an asset, its $178 billion value already exceeds that of about 95% of the S&P 500 Index members and is driving the debate about where financial technology is headed. I think the issue here is the disruptive nature of technology for banks. Whether it's the application of blockchain, or their core processing, or delivery to customers or clients, financial services today is being disrupted by technology. The rising profile of digital currencies even saw bitcoin feature in the Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday for Federal Reserve chairman nominee Jerome Powell, who's a current board member. Answering a senator's question, he said that cryptocurrencies are something we monitor very carefully, and that at some point their volumes could matter for monetary policy, though not today. It's the start of broader attention and adoption by the investing public. There's no agreed authority for the price of bitcoin, and quotes can vary significantly across exchanges. In Zimbabwe, where there's a lack of confidence in the local financial system, the cryptocurrency has traded at a persistent premium over $10,000. Volumes are also difficult to assess. Bloomberg publishes a price that draws on several large bitcoin trading venues. It was at $11,254.75, up 13%, as of 9:16 am New York time. From Wall Street executives to venture capitalists, observers have been weighing in, with some more skeptical than others as bitcoin's rise has grown steeper, sweeping along individual investors. The number of accounts at Coinbase, one of the largest platforms for trading bitcoin and rival ethereum, has almost tripled to 13 million in the past year, according to Bespoke Investment Group LLC. In a move toward mainstream investing, CME Group Inc has said it plans to start offering futures contracts for bitcoin, which could begin trading in December. JPMorgan Chase & Co, the largest US bank, was weighing last week whether to help clients bet on bitcoin via the proposed futures contracts, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. This is going to be the biggest bubble of our lifetimes, hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz said at a cryptocurrency conference Tuesday in New York. Novogratz, who's says he began investing in bitcoin when it was at $90, is starting a $500 million fund because of the potential for the technology to eventually transform financial markets. The total market cap of digital currencies now sits north of $330 billion, according to data on Coinmarketcap.com's website. For Peter Rosenstreich, head of market strategy at online trading firm Swissquote Bank SA, bitcoin's surge harks back to the surprises of the UK referendum on European Union membership and President Donald Trump's election. We have underestimated the populist movements, he said. There is growing unease on how central banks and governments are managing fiat currencies. Ordinary people globally understand why a decentralized asset is the ultimate safe haven.",http://www.livemint.com/Money/i6l1vNsqD09XKpEKEQ3RXL/Bitcoin-tops-10000-for-first-time-as-bubble-warnings-mult.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

In its recommendations on net neutrality, the TRAI on Tuesday said that telecom operators should be barred from being discriminatory in providing internet access.","Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) Chairman RS Sharma on Tuesday said that the Internet should be kept open and free to all and that it should not be cannibalised. So, it should be open and accessible to everyone, Sharma said, suggesting that service providers should not indulge in gate-keeping of this important platform. TRAI on Tuesday issued the much-awaited recommendations on net neutrality and has sought to bar telecom service providers from any discriminatory practice on Internet access. So, it is important that the platform is kept open and free and not cannibalised, Sharma told reporters. Asked about the Indian regulator upholding principles of net neutrality when, in fact, US Federal Communications Commission has proposed to roll back net neutrality rules of 2015, Sharma said Trai has kept the Indian context in mind while framing its recommendations. We have 500 million net subscribers and 1.3 billion population. Big things will happen on Internet and it is important to keep it open, Sharma stressed. He observed that networks should be neutral to content being accessed. Networks should not prefer one content over other. Should not block or offer fast lane , he pointed out. TRAI, in its recommendations today, has however allowed certain exemptions and exclusions, including specialised services and time-critical Internet of Things services. These specialised services - the likes of tele-surgery etc - will be identified by the telecom department, which will also take a final call on Trai's overall recommendations on net neutrality. TRAI has also stated that Content Delivery Networks which enable telecom operators to deliver content within their network without going through public Internet should be exempted. The regulator has allowed Internet service providers to take reasonable measurements for traffic management provided they are proportionate, transient, and transparent. Pending decision by the telecom department on its recommendations, TRAI will continue to enforce conditions of licensing that advocates non-discrimination. Sharma declined to comment on the timeframe for making the latest net neutrality framework effective, saying the regulator has sent its recommendations to the telecom department and the latter has to now take a view. Asked about the fine that will be imposed for any violation, Sharma said the penalty for violation of licence conditions will also be applicable in such cases and no separate penalty had been proposed by the regulator for violation of net neutrality rules. The regulator will come out with a consultation paper on Over The Top (OTT) very soon.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/internet-should-be-open-and-free-not-cannibalised-trai-chief-on-net-neutrality/story-rL51ImTJjuef9SHeUJtAAP.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
31,"Gujarat govt gave us a loan, not a grant: Tata Motors","Denying reports that the Gujarat government issued a grant to Tata Motors, the company clarified that it was a nearly ₹590-crore loan. Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi had alleged that the BJP-led Gujarat government gave ₹33,000-crore worth benefits to the automaker for its Nano plant. Tata Motors said the loan has to be repaid as per the loan agreement executed.","The investor-friendly environment created by the Gujarat government encouraged Tata Motors to set up its manufacturing plant in Sanand, with a long-term vision to make it one of the leading automotive hubs, further enabling the state to contribute to the prosperity and growth of India, the company said in an official statement. Tata Motors said it has received a loan of Rs 584.8 crore from the state government till now and it is repayable. Given the scale of the project and its potential to drive growth in the state, the Gujarat government offered Tata Motors an incentive package in the form of a loan, which is to be repaid to the state government as per the loan agreement executed, said the statement. The loan given to Tata Motors is from taxes paid by the company. The company also claimed that after the establishment of the plant at Sanand, there has been a spurt in economic activity and growth in employment within the state, making Gujarat one of the key auto hubs within the country with huge employment generation. The project has also given rise to capital investments, which has further resulted in the development of incidental industrial activities and employment generation in small and medium scale industries, it further claimed.

32,Turkish religious authority declares Bitcoin 'un-Islamic',"Warning citizens against buying and selling Bitcoin, Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs has said that the cryptocurrency is not in accordance with Islam. Adding that Bitcoin had not been authorised by the state, the religious body said that the cryptocurrency is widely used for illegal activities and is not sufficiently regulated.","As Bitcoin's value shoots up, Turkey's highest religious authority has declared that buying and selling the cryptocurrency is at odds with religion due to its lack of regulation and close connection to criminal activities, local media report. Following a meeting on Friday, Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs, also known as the Diyanet, released an official statement advising Turks against investing in online cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The purchase and selling of digital currencies is not appropriate according to religion at this point due to the fact that they are open to speculation in terms of value and they can easily be used mostly in illegal deeds such as money laundering. They are also far from state auditing and supervision, the Diyanet's statement read, as quoted in the Hurriyet Daily News. The Diyanet's statement comes as the value of one Bitcoin shot up to $10,000 for the first time on Tuesday, up from $7,979 last week. While the news has excited investors, some financial experts have warned that the currency may be highly unstable. In September, Nobel Laureate and economist Robert Shiller said Bitcoin was the best example of a bubble that will eventually burst. Unlike other online payment systems, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin don't have to be linked to any particular named account, in theory making them untraceable. This makes them ideal for criminals, most infamously the Silk Road online drug market, which was brought down by US authorities in 2013. Though it's possible to track down the exact Bitcoins involved in a given transaction, those with something to hide can launder their cryptocurrency by running it through a 'tumbler,' which muddies the paper trail by mixing up transactions. Though the Diyanet may have declared Bitcoin inappropriate from the point of view of religion, interest in the cryptocurrency is growing in Turkey. A Turkish Lira-Bitcoin exchange, BTCTurk, has been set up, and there is a Bitcoin ATM near the Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. In September, the Miavita Beytepe apartment complex in Ankara said it would be accepting Bitcoin for luxury homes, while earlier in November, the president of Turkey's Central Bank said his organization is looking into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies together with the government to see if they can contribute to financial stability.",https://www.rt.com/news/411341-bitcoin-islam-religion-turkey/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

34,"US dollar gained over 10,000% in last 2 years in Venezuela","The value of US dollar grew 10,768% against the Venezuelan bolívar over the past two years in the black market. The bolívar traded at 96,794 per US dollar on Wednesday after the dollar gained 2,959% so far this year, according to tracking website 'dolartoday.com'. The Venezuelan currency had collapsed amid a crisis caused by the country's socialist policies and hyperinflation.","The speed at which the Venezuelan bolivar is sinking against the dollar is hard to fathom. It's one of those rare market moves that's so crazy that analyzing it from the perspective of the declining currency feels inadequate. That's because the value of a currency, of course, can't fall more than 99.99 percent. Gains, on the other hand, are infinite. And so it's more illuminating to examine the move from the angle of the dollar's advance against the bolivar. In the black market - the place where most Venezuelans acquire dollars in the authoritarian country - the US currency has risen 135 percent this month alone, according to dolartoday.com, the go-to site for pricing. So far this year, it's up 2,959 percent. And over the past two years, it's climbed 10,768 percent. Venezuela's finances and economy crumbled long ago under the strain of the government's socialist policies. But the hyperinflation spiral intensified after President Nicolas Maduro ratcheted up spending - and financed it by cranking up the central bank printing presses - to curry favor in the run-up to this year's controversial vote on whether to install a constituent assembly and further tighten his grip on power. Maduro's plan, unveiled earlier this month, to restructure the country's foreign debt only added to the jitters and sense of chaos on the ground in Caracas. The bolivar traded at 96,794 per dollar as of late Wednesday, according to dolartoday.com. It had started the week at 82,186 per dollar and hovered under 10,000 per dollars as recently as late July. The situation has become so out of control that some within Maduro's constituent assembly - including a former trade and investment minister - have even begun talking about something that's long been taboo for them: the idea of re-implementing some free-market policies.",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-30/in-venezuela-the-dollar-s-gained-10-768-in-just-last-two-years?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

Bitcoin plunged as much as 20% just hours after the cryptocurrency set an all-time high of above $11,000, as sell orders began piling up. The heaviest selling came amid reports of service outages and delays on some of the largest online exchanges.","It takes a lot to startle fans of bitcoin, the digital gold of the moment. But Wednesday was, well, a lot-a wild run of exuberant peaks and white-knuckled declines that left even diehards breathless. The dizzying rally in bitcoin, a bull market with few precedents in investing history, was abruptly interrupted by a market outage in the US that seemed to captivate Wall Street even more than the day's selloff in high-flying technology stocks. Only hours after soaring past $11,000-a price that represents a gain of more than two-fold since September-bitcoin plunged nearly 20% in less than 90 minutes to a low of $9,009 in New York. Whether the swoon represented a brief setback or the start of something worse, the wild ride underscored just how volatile the cryptocurrency has become in what some warn could be one of the biggest bubbles of all time. Bitcoin trading isn't for the novice investor, said John Spallanzani, chief macro strategist at GFI Securities LLC in New York, who does technical analysis on the cryptocurrency. Corrections are fast and furious and you can get run over just like in the movie. The day started with a touch of frenzy in the air, as the digital currency took its first trip past $10,000 and pop icon Katy Perry was tweeting about her fascination with the rally. But things suddenly seized up during US hours when traffic swelled on online exchanges. Confusion reined in the market for hours. Investors fearful of missing out on the frenzy were greeted instead with service outages and delays. Coinbase tweeted that traffic on its platform hit an all-time high at eight times the peak demand experienced in June. Access remained unavailable to some users. The selling reached furious levels shortly after 1pm in New York, when bitcoin fell back below $11,000 and didn't stop until $9,009. It hovered just below $10,000 as of 4.30 pm. Issues in the exchanges add to it without a doubt, said David Mondrus, chief executive of Trive, a blockchain-based research platform. When you have a lack of ability to exit, then people dump in order to exit faster. For many, the retreat was overdue after bitcoin had rallied 20% in just four days in a run-up that drew increased warnings it was headed for a sharp retreat. The cryptocurrency ended September at $4,171.25. It's a bubble that's going to give a lot of people a lot of exciting times as it rides up and then goes down, Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said in a Bloomberg Television interview Wednesday. Bitcoin is successful only because of its potential for circumvention, lack of oversight. So it seems to me it ought to be outlawed. He joins a host of economists and financiers who've denounced the crypto rally as a craze, including most recently Vanguard Group Inc founder Jack Bogle, who advised investors to avoid bitcoin like the plague. Those kind of gains have grabbed Wall Street's attention, evident Tuesday as buttoned-up financiers and analysts piled into CoinDesk's cryptocurrencies conference in Manhattan, turning the event into a standing-room-only affair. Still, Wednesday's jarring reversal had Spallanzani reminding investors that the ride down might not be over, at least for now.

Reacting to Bitcoin's recent price surge, Bogle said, ""When it gets back to $100, we'll talk.""
","Bitcoin has no underlying rate of return, said Bogle, 88, who started the first index fund in 1976. You know bonds have an interest coupon, stocks have earnings and dividends, gold has nothing.

37,This is a pause in the declining trend: Chidambaram on GDP,"Congress leader P Chidambaram has said that improvement in GDP growth to 6.3% in the September quarter is ""a pause in the declining trend of the last five quarters"". He further said the growth is far below the potential of a well-managed Indian economy. ""We should wait for growth rates over next 3-4 quarters before reaching a conclusion,"" he added.","Former Union Finance Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Thursday welcomed the improvement in GDP growth, however, he said that it is too early to say that the upward trend would continue for the rest of the financial year. Chidambaram added that the 6.3% growth in the GDP was far from what the Modi government had promised. India's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the July-September quarter improved to 6.3 per cent from a year earlier. Chidambaram, who has been severely criticising the economic policies of the Modi government, said it was good to notice a 'pause' in the declining trend that the GDP witnessed in the last five months but added that the real picture would emerge in months to come. Happy that the July-Sep quarter has registered a growth rate of 6.3%. But we cannot say now whether this will mark an upward trend in the growth rate, Chidambaram said. We should wait for the growth rates over the next 3-4 quarters before we can reach a definite conclusion, he added. Earlier in the day, while responding Prime Minister Narendra Modi for criticising the Congress party after it demanded an 18-per cent cap on GST rates, saying whether the government's Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) was stupid for having a similar view. If it is Grand Stupid Thought to argue for a cap of the tax rate at 18%, then CEA Dr Arvind Subramanian and many other economists are stupid. Modi, who addressed four back-to-back election rallies in Gujarat on Wednesday, targeted Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on the Goods and Services Tax (GST). In a rebuttal to Gandhi's repeated criticism of the GST, a key economic reform undertaken by the NDA government, Modi said a recently emerged economist was propagating a grand stupid thought by suggesting a uniform GST rate of 18 per cent.",http://www.india.com/business/ex-finance-minister-p-chidambaram-welcomes-improvement-in-gdp-growth-but-advises-caution-2697150/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

""India is witnessing a demographic shift in the workforce,"" she added.","ICICI Bank Managing Director and CEO Chanda Kochhar on Wednesday highlighted that there is no other country in the world other than India where 40 percent of the banking sector is headed by women. Not even 25 percent of graduate women in India participate in the workforce. We can add, in the next eight to ten years, 700 billion dollars to our own GDP if we actually bridge this gender gap, said Chanda Kochar while speaking at the 8th edition of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES). Sharing her thoughts over how has India come a long way, the ICICI Bank chief said India is doing way better than most other countries in the world. India is witnessing a demographic shift in the workforce. The changing structure of the economy is encouraging more women to start their careers resulting in more women in the fields of sports, governance and banking, added Kochhar. Chanda highlighted various skill training opportunities and programs developed by ICICI Bank to ensure a livelihood for women across villages in India and increase employment. We have started a whole skill training initiative across India and through that what we have done is we train those underprivileged youth who are not able to afford higher education. We fix skills which are relevant for this kind of youth. We have 24 training centers in urban and semi-urban areas in the country plus around 500 villages where we have taken this skill training initiative, added Kochchar. If you educate a man you educate an individual; if you educate a woman you educate a generation, she concluded. Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pitched for women empowerment stressing it is vital for overall development of the nation. Indian women continue to lead in different walks of life. Our space programmes, including the Mars Orbiter Mission, have had immense contribution from women scientists. Kalpana Chawla and Sunita Williams, both of Indian origin, have been part of US space missions, the prime minister had said. Prime Minister Modi also outlined the focus areas of the summit including healthcare, digital economy, media and energy saying all are most relevant and important to mankind today. He further stressed that the summit not only connects Silicon Valley to Hyderabad but also strengthens the ties between US and India. On a related note, the summit is being hosted for the first time in South East Asia by the Governments of India and the United States.

42,Automation could kill 800 million jobs by 2030: McKinsey,"As many as 800 million workers worldwide may lose their jobs to robots and automation by 2030, according to a report by McKinsey Global Institute. Machine operators, fast-food workers and back-office employees are among those who will be most affected, the report added. The research by McKinsey covered 46 nations and more than 800 occupations.","As many as 800 million workers worldwide may lose their jobs to robots and automation by 2030, equivalent to more than a fifth of today's global labor force. That's according to a new report covering 46 nations and more than 800 occupations by the research arm of McKinsey & Co The consulting company said Wednesday that both developed and emerging countries will be impacted. Machine operators, fast-food workers and back-office employees are among those who will be most affected if automation spreads quickly through the workplace. Even if the rise of robots is less rapid, some 400 million workers could still find themselves displaced by automation and would need to find new jobs over the next 13 years, the McKinsey Global Institute study found. The good news for those displaced is that there will be jobs for them to transition into, although in many cases they're going to have to learn new skills to do the work. Those jobs will include health-care providers for aging populations, technology specialists and even gardeners, according to the report. We're all going to have to change and learn how to do new things over time, Michael Chui, a San Francisco-based partner at the institute, said in an interview.

43,GST slabs could come down to three: Arun Jaitley,"Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said GST Council could consider merging slabs of 12% and 18%, and cutting the number of items taxed at 28%. He added that the speed of rationalisation of GST rates will depend on how revenues stabilise. Earlier, GST on 178 goods was reduced to 18% from 28%, leaving only 50 items in the highest slab.","Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday hinted that tax rates under the goods and services tax (GST) could be rationalized to three slabs as revenues under the new indirect tax regime stabilize. Jaitley indicated the GST Council could consider merging the current slabs of 12% and 18% into one rate and reduce the number of items that are taxed under the highest slab of 28%. We started the rationalization ahead of schedule. We have thinned down the 28% bracket. Going ahead, we will rationalize it further to probably tax only luxury and demerit goods at 28%. We have to maintain revenue neutrality, Jaitley said at the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit. You have 5%, then this 'X' rate after merging 12% and 18% and then the very thin slab of 28%. Eventually that will be the direction, Jaitley said, adding the speed of this rationalization will depend on how revenues pick up. Earlier this month, the GST Council brought down the number of items that are taxed under the 28% slab to 50 from 227, reducing the rate on items ranging from soaps and shampoos to tyre tubes. Besides, a cess is levied on some sin and luxury goods over and above the tax rate of 28%. Jaitley defended the government's decision to bring in multiple tax slabs at the beginning of the implementation of the tax on 1 July. In a highly differentiated society like India, we cannot have a single rate. The Congress party raised this in Parliament, asking for a single rate. GST removed barriers to trade in goods and services across states, subsuming a range of central, state and local taxes and unifying the country into a common market. But its implementation has confronted teething problems, prompting the GST council to make several revisions to address concerns raised by taxpayers. Jaitley pointed out that the government has been able to minimize the inflationary impact because of the multiple rate structure. By this process, we have been able to avoid the inflationary impact. The teething problems are transitional (and not necessarily because of the multiple rate structure, he said.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/htls/htls-2017-gst-slabs-could-come-down-to-three-says-arun-jaitley/story-5CH8c1mnYvgTw1RxMjNWMN.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

The 56-year-old is currently the Managing Director of Bangalore Metro. Kharola has a PhD in public transport systems from IIT Delhi and was the Principal Secretary to the then CM of Karnataka in 2013.","As state-run carrier Air India gears up to go private, its top-level management is also witnessing some changes. In tune, senior IAS officer Pradeep Singh Kharola has now been appointed as the chairman and managing director of Air India, replacing interim CMD Rajiv Bansal, who has been at the helm for about three months. Kharola is currently based in Bengaluru and it is not known when he will take over as the CMD of Air India. I have just received the email, Mint quoted Kharola as saying. An Air India official also told the daily that there was no information on when he would be coming on board. The decision seems to have been welcomed by quite a few and a bureaucrat told the daily that much was expected of him. While continuity would have been nice for the airline, he is also a good choice and generally known to be a doer in his Karnataka cadre, the bureaucrat said on condition of anonymity. In Air India, Kharola will be responsible for running the operations of the carrier and minimising costs and the current losses the airline has been battling. The 56-year-old is known to be a workaholic and led the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC), which raised investments from international sources to build infrastructure in cities. The head of BMRCL, known for his soft-spoken nature, made headlines for being one of the most efficient senior IAS officers. He is credited with turning around the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) from a loss making entity to a profitable venture in the year 2000, reported Business Standard. Since then the BMTC has continued making profits, which also helped it deploy air-conditioned buses in the city. But what really put Kharola on the map was his role in the development of the Bangalore Metro since February 2015. When he came on board the BMRCL, the Bangalore metro was in service only between Baiyyappanahalli and MG Road. However, the development picked up pace since Kharola's appointment and he has been lauded for pushing the completion of the first phase that runs through 42 km of the city. Now, all eyes will be on Kharola to see whether he has a similar effect on Air India as well, which is reeling under losses estimated at about Rs 50,000 crore.",http://www.ibtimes.co.in/who-pradeep-kharola-new-chairman-managing-director-air-india-751237?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

The firm said the asserted claims are ""without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegation"".","Hyderabad-based drugmaker Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd on Wednesday said it had been served a securities class action lawsuit in the US for alleged violations of federal securities laws. The lawsuit, filed in the US district court of New Jersey, seeks damages to compensate investors for a purported decline in Dr Reddy's share price caused by alleged misstatements or omissions by the company. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) besides Indian exchanges. Further to our intimation dated August 28, 2017 with regard to US securities class action lawsuit, we would like to inform you that the US securities class action lawsuit has been served on the company in the US by the lead plaintiff, Dr Reddy's said a notice to BSE. In the notice, the company said it believes the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegation. In a class action lawsuit, one or several persons sue on behalf of a larger group, referred to as the class, if a dispute is common to all and the number of affected people is large.

A number of US law firms had in August called upon investors to move class action lawsuits on charges that the company had given misleading statements related to issues of manufacturing compliance at its Indian facilities. According to Vijay Pal Dalmia, senior litigator and partner at law firm Vaish Associates, Dr Reddy's could face serious financial implications. In this particular case there will be a collective liability towards the group of people who purchased the shares between particular dates. This is going to have serious financial consequences on the firm, Dalmia said. An analyst at securities house Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd said on condition of anonymity that it would be too early to guess a financial loss to the company, while conceding that it's a negative development sentimentally. The tight regulatory vigil by the US FDA has been a cause of concern for the pharmaceutical industry in India. There has been a spurt in negative observations by it recently. Dr Reddy's has constantly been at the receiving end of US FDA interventions. While the Miryalaguda plant was cleared by the US FDA earlier this year, the other two units are still under the scanner. On 6 November, Lupin Ltd received certain observations on its facilities in Goa and Aurangabad from the US drug regulator.

48,I got death threats from BCCI treasurer: BCCI CFO,"The BCCI's Chief Financial Officer Santosh Rangnekar has alleged that treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry issued multiple ""death threats"" to him. Rangnekar submitted a written statement to the Supreme Court narrating three separate incidents including being asked to take potassium cyanide by Chaudhry. The Supreme Court has given two weeks time to BCCI and Chaudhry to respond to the complaint by Rangnekar. ","The ugly battle to wrest control of the BCCI plummeted to a new low on Wednesday when senior advocate Gopal Subramanium told the Supreme Court that the Board treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry had, allegedly, given multiple death threats to the Board's Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Santosh Rangnekar. Subramanium, the amicus curiae in the ongoing 2013-IPL betting-fixing case, sensationally disclosed that Rangnekar had alleged three death threats in an the email he sent to the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) and BCCI CEO Rahul Johri on October 11. The three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Dipak Mishra, then told Chaudhry to respond to the charge within two weeks. Subramanium said the CoA's solicitor had given Rangnekar's complaint to him. Chaudhry, who was present in the court and was wearing a lawyer's gown as he himself is a lawyer, expressed surprise at the allegation and completely denied all three incidents narrated by Rangnekar. After the hearing, he told reporters that it was the first time that he was being told about these threats. The court has asked to me to respond and I will reply, he told reporters outside Court No1. Both CEO Johri and Rangnekar, along with Chaudhry's Executive Assistant Gaurav Virmani, were present in the court during the hearing. The bench fixed the next hearing in the second week of January. No office-bearer has any authority to administer threats to the CFO - to say that he will be liquidated, Subramanium told the bench. Chaudhry, son of politician and former BCCI president Ranbir Singh Mahendra and grandson of former Haryana chief minister Bansi Lal, lives in Bhiwani. He is widely considered close to former BCCI president N Srinivasan. I have sounded my family about all the above events. If anything happens to me in near future then one should know, who may be held responsible for that, Rangnekar wrote in his email. Being a lawyer, his behaviour with me in public and private is totally different. When he gives me a threat, he doesn't keep any evidence behind. The Mumbai-based Rangnekar says in his letter that during all three one-way communication he had preferred to remain totally silent. I just concentrate on my job that is, accounts/audit/finance/treasury function, for which I am responsible for. This is for your information, he concluded his message to the COA and the CEO. According to Rangnekar's email, Chaudhry had given him death threat on January 21 and twice on October 6. The first incident allegedly took place at the BCCI headquarters in Mumbai. Venue: Conference room adjacent to CFO office on 1st Floor, Cricket Centre, Mumbai. Incident: HT called me inside the conference room. He told me to switch off my cell phone. Checked whether any camera is there in the conference room. Then said that FIR will be filed on CEO and CFO (myself) for misappropriation of funds that is, because we used UBI account to run BCCI's operations for the period 2 Jan to 20 Jan 2017. Then further said that this FIR will be finally turned as fake/untrue or court will reject the same but till that time for next 2 years at least our life will be totally finished. On that I just said that CEO and CFO (myself) have acted on the basis of written instructions from SC/Lodha/Amicus Curie. HT said if I would have been in Haryana, by now I would have been evaporated. Know one knew whether I was there in this world ever. Present: HT and myself, writes Rangnekar. The CFO narrates the alleged second instance thus: Date: 6 Oct 2017. Venue: Pavilion Coffee shop at ITC Maurya, New Delhi. Incident: HT said that I should take Potassium Cyanide instead of Solvine. HT made this comment with a smile - Death Threat. Incident: HT said he will finish me soon. Ab mera time aa gaya hai. Do one mistake and kahlass karunga tumko. Present: HT, Gaurav Virmani and myself, he illustrates. There have been many reports of the BCCI being a completely fragmented body ever since the 2013 IPL betting-fixing case reached the Supreme Court. Widening its scope, the court appointed the Lodha Committee to give recommendations to reform the BCCI. After the court upheld most of the recommendations in the Lodha Committee Report - and later sacked then president Anurag Thakur and secretary Ajay shirke - the BCCI virtually split vertically. Today, acting president CK Khanna, acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary and Anirudh Chaudhry are reportedly pulling in different directions. The former CAG Vinod Rai-headed CoA hasn't been able to reform the BCCI so far as the various stake holders have been resisting it tooth and nail. But Wednesday's sensational development seems to have put all previous ugly incidents to shame. It remains to be seen how the court reacts to Chaudhry's explanation once it is submitted.",https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/sc-tells-bcci-treasurer-to-explain-alleged-death-threats-to-boards-chief-financi/304973?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
49,Boxing Federation of India gets official recognition by IOA,The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) was on Wednesday recognised as a national body by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA). This comes after the IOA removed the terminated Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) as its affiliate. The BFI assumed office last year after elections conducted in the presence of observers from the International Amateur Boxing Association and the Sports Ministry.,"The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) was recognised as a national body by the Indian Olympic Association, which removed the terminated Indian Amateur Boxing Federation (IABF) as its affiliate after months of indecision. The BFI, already recognised by the International Boxing Association (AIBA) and the Sports Ministry, finally got the IOA's nod, which had IABF registered as the official body till now. The Olympic Charter clearly says that the sporting federation must be recognised by the international body. Therefore the IOA has ratified the Olympic charter. It was a unanimous decision, BFI President Ajay Singh told PTI on the sidelines of an IOA meeting. The IOA's decision is expected to end the IABF's attempts at reviving itself. The body, which was first suspended and then terminated by AIBA for manipulation in elections, has been trying to keep itself afloat by organising a couple of meetings with its former members in the past few months. The Sports Ministry had earlier barred IABF from using India as it was no longer a national federation. The BFI assumed office last year after elections conducted in the presence of observers from the AIBA and the Sports Ministry.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/boxing-federation-of-india-gets-official-recognition-by-indian-olympic-association/story-68RytuOVyBKrUhMVKBkMUP.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
50,BCCI approves pay hike for Indian men's cricket team,"The BCCI has approved a pay hike for Team India following a meeting with Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni on Thursday. This comes months after the BCCI doubled annual retainer amounts of Team India, with Grade A players earning ₹2 crore. Earlier, former coach Anil Kumble had asked BCCI to raise Grade A cricketers' annual retainer amount to ₹5 crore.","The Committee of Administrators (CoA) has approved a pay hike for Team India cricketers after a meeting with skipper Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni and Ravi Shastri in New Delhi on Thursday. The details of the increase in pay will soon be worked out and it is likely the COA will meet the players before they depart for their tour of South Africa late in December. COA chief Vinod Rai said his committee has found a common ground with the players in a path-breaking initiative. The team management was very forthcoming with their recommendations and their thoughts on various issues. This was a path-breaking initiative, we feel we've found a common ground and aligned our thoughts for the betterment of the game - be it the policies under which the player remuneration and FTP will be worked upon. A few months ago, the Indian cricketers' central contracts saw a two-fold rise with top players in group A earning Rs 2 crore annually. Earlier, they were drawing Rs 1 crore. Despite the cent percent hike in annual contracts, the players were apparently still not happy and erstwhile coach Anil Kumble had given a presentation to the the Committee of Administrators about raising it to Rs 5 crore for Grade A cricketers. The CoA, in its third Status Report submitted to the Supreme Court on April 6, had stated about the proposed recommendations on restructuring of central contracts. Unlike reports that players want share from the IPL broadcast revenue, they have never ever said anything like that. Yes, they have spoken about a respectable rise. The COA also understands that their payment structure needs revision, a senior BCCI office bearer was quoted as saying to PTI. However, the COA's decision on the pay hike would need a nod from the BCCI's general body. A Special General Meeting needs to be summoned where all the members will be taking a call. This is as per constitution of BCCI, an official had told PTI on Tuesday. The Indian players believe that someone like Cheteshwar Pujara, who does not have a lucrative IPL contract, needs to be adequately compensated for his skills in Test cricket. Currently the Indian players earn less than 8 percent (7.8 percent) of BCCI revenues. During the meeting on Thursday, it was also decided the team would leave for England two weeks before their first match for the tour of 2018 to prepare and get used to conditions. Last week, Kohli had asked for more time to prepare before challenging overseas tours. Had we got a month off ideally, we would have done a proper preparation in a camp sort of scenario but we have to sort of make do with what we have, Kohli had said before the start of the second Test against Sri Lanka in Nagpur. As usual cramped for time, which I think we needed to assess in future as well because we very easily assess the team when go abroad but we don't look at how many days we have got to prepare before we go to a particular place to play. And everyone starts judging players when results come after Test matches. It should be a fair game, where we get to prepare the way we want to and then we are entitled to be criticised. So we thought this is an ample opportunity for us to challenge ourselves, put us in a situation , Kohli added.",http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/virat-kohli-coa-pay-hike-overseas-tour-south-africa-england/1/1100338.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
51,PCB files ₹450 cr compensation claim against BCCI with ICC,"The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sent a notice of dispute against the BCCI to the ICC for not honouring a bilateral cricket series agreement. The PCB is seeking ₹450 crore in compensation from the BCCI for failing to play bilateral series in 2014 and 2015. The matter will be forwarded to the Dispute Resolutions Committee's Chairman, the ICC said.","Pakistan has kicked off a legal battle against India for not honouring a bilateral cricket series agreement, the sport's governing body confirmed Thursday. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is seeking US70 million in compensation from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) after the country failed to attend two series in 2014 and 2015 as part of a memorandum of understanding signed between the two boards. The International Cricket Council confirmed receiving the notice. The ICC has received a Notice of Dispute from the PCB's lawyers, which will be forwarded to the Chairman of the Dispute Resolutions Committee next week, a spokesman of the ICC said. The ICC Dispute Resolution Committee is headed by Michael Beloff QC who will appoint independent adjudicators to hear the case. The PCB sent a legal notice to their counterparts earlier this year but Indian officials rejected the memorandum as a piece of paper. The arch-rivals have not played a full bilateral series since 2007. New Delhi halted all bilateral sports with Pakistan in the wake of 2008 Mumbai attacks, which India blamed on militants based in Pakistan.

52,Don Bradman was dropped from the team after his debut match,"Legendary batsman Donald Bradman was dropped from the Australian team after a poor performance in his debut Test against England, which started on November 30, 1928. Bradman batted at number seven in his debut innings, scoring 18, and was dismissed for one in the second innings. On his return, Bradman scored 79 and 112 against England. ","Don Bradman took the field for Australia in a Test match for the first time. However, the result was not too happy for the legend or the Australians. In this series, Arunabha Sengupta lists several firsts of Bradmanas career. It was not an uneasy evening for the 20-year-old. His last two First-Class matches had seen him pile up 131, 133 not out, 87 and 132 not out; the second game played for his state against the visiting MCC side. In the ongoing match against the same MCC, this time for an Australian XI, he had battled against difficult bowling in demanding conditions and hit 58 not out as the rest of the batting fell away around him. Now, as he waited restlessly that evening, he knew he had to bat the following day. In the second innings, he had just gone into bat when the stumps were drawn. He had not opened his account yet. Yet, for all the 541 runs for twice out, his heart was not at ease. Even with an average of 140 in the season so far, Don Bradman was not sure that he would be making his Test debut. After all, he had played only 9 First-Class matches in his career. The Australian selectors were not enamoured by the concept of youth. For them, Test cricket was more of an old manas game, or had become one in the first quarter of the new century. Charles Kelleway, one of the seasoned men who was to play in the Test, had been around in First-Class cricket since before Bradmanas birth. So, the young master waited restlessly in his Sydney lodgings, waiting for the announcement. The wireless was on, airing desultory programmes, refusing to broadcast the names. The upcoming genius did not know that Bardsley and the rest had already deliberated for over three hours, and the meeting was going on well into the night. The prospect of facing Maurice Tate, Harold Larwood and Jack White the next day on a wearying track was not an inviting one. Bradman, after the tension-filled sojourn in front of the wireless, informed his landlady that he was retiring to bed. He would read about the team in the papers of the morrow. However, as he tucked himself in, he could hear the sound floating in from the wireless in the adjoining bedroom. After ten minutes, before he had succeeded in drifting off, The Don heard the announcement. The names were called out in alphabetical order. Bradman was the first, followed by Jack Gregory, Clarrie Grimmett, Stork Hendry and the others. The wait had ended, and he was in. The prevailing opinion was that either he or Hendry would perform the role of the 12th man. Yet, eventually it turned out that both played and Ron Oxenham was the one left out. It was the first ever Test to be played at Brisbane. Besides, Percy Chapmanas side was widely acknowledged to be the best ever to visit the country till then. Historical and contemporary signs were against the hosts. It turned out to be an unhappy match for Bradman. For most of the first two days, he retrieved balls from the outfield as Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe set the tone with an 85-run partnership before Patsy Hendren took over the show, slamming 169. Even Larwood enjoyed himself, scoring 70 entertaining runs. The total of 521 loomed ominously on the Australians as they went in to bat towards the end of the second day. Soon, Larwood and Tate were skittling them out. The batsmen were knocked over one after the other. Skipper Jack Ryder held Bradman back as the day ended with the hosts on 44 for 4. The following morning, Larwood trapped Hendry leg-before to make it 71 for 5, and with that precarious scorecard in the background, Don Bradman walked in to bat for the first time in a Test. There was plenty of confidence in the strokes that flowed. The boundary was found quickly, and then again. He hit four fours in all, three of them to leg-side, three off Wally Hammond. A delivery on the leg-stump was pushed to the on side for runs. The next one followed the same arc, looked identical. Bradman pushed in a similar manner. The great big hand of Tate had cleverly concealed the slower ball. The thud was ominous and the finger went up. After 33 minutes at the crease Bradman walked back for 18, one of the eight leg-before dismissals in the match. It turned out to be the third-highest score in the innings, after Hendry and Ryder, but Bradman knew he had not delivered. Larwood took 6 and Tate 3, and Australia folded for 122. And then took place a significant event that would affect Bradman much more than the runs he scored and the balls he faced in the match. The lead of 399 notwithstanding, Chapman batted again. Gregory had busted his knee and Kelleway was ill. Hence, Grimmett and Bradmanas fellow debutant Bert Ironmonger had to do bulk of the bowling. England made merry for about six hours, scoring another 342. Australia were set a mammoth 742 to win, the highest target at that time. If Bradman soon developed into a ruthless opponent of England who would pile on runs mercilessly, refusing to concede an inch, there is reason to believe that the English tactics during that debut Test had a lot to do with it. Bradman had never even seen such a sticky before this, let alone batting on one. He lasted four minutes before White sent in his slower ball, and the catch was spooned to Chapman lurking in the off side. As he walked back for a solitary run, Tate playfully accused White of poaching his arabbita. Unfortunately for Tate and England, the young lad overheard the remark. It was probably the second significant event of the match that moulded his career. Both the bowler and the old foe would pay for it dearly for two decades. Australia were bowled out for 66 on that mud cake. England won by 675 runs, the heaviest defeat they had inflicted on their Ashes rivals. Bradman never quite forgot the humiliation handed out at the Exhibition Ground, Brisbane. Nine days later the sides clashed at the SCG in the second Test. A quarter of an hour before the start of the match, captain Ryder informed young Bradman that he would be the 12th man. That was the only occasion in any form of cricket that Bradman would play that unenviable role of carrying drinks. He had to work hard as well. With Bill Ponsford breaking his little finger, he had to field all through the England innings. Back for the third Test at the MCG, Bradman hammered 79 and 112. No one ever questioned his place in the side again. Brief scores: England 521 and 342 for 8 decl. Beat Australia 122 and 66 by 675 runs.",http://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/don-bradman-firsts-part-4-his-disappointing-test-debut-322645?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

""Try to get up and get punched in the face every day when you've got $100 million in the bank. Money changes everything with a lot of people,"" he added.","The future of UFC lightweight champion Conor McGregor remains up in the air. McGregor has not fought for the promotion since he won the lightweight title from Eddie Alvarez in November 2016. He did fight Floyd Mayweather in an incredibly lucrative boxing match in August and the Irish fighter's payday from that bout might be the reason he hasn't defended his lightweight title. Conor might never fight again, White told reporters Tuesday at UFC headquarters. The guy's got $100 (expletive) million. I've got guys that made less than that and were lawyers and went to school their whole life and quit working. Despite those words, White is hopeful that he and McGregor's team can come up with a number that will bring the promotion's biggest draw back to the octagon at some point. However, the UFC President didn't seem too interested in giving in to McGregor's recent demand for equity in the company. Despite that, White seems fully aware of what McGregor means to the UFC's bottom line. There's guys who always (expletive) about money, White said, Conor can't be paid enough money.

54,World's 1st stadium that can be reassembled to come up in Qatar,"The design of the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, the world's first fully demountable football stadium to be used for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, has been unveiled. Shipping containers will be used as one of the main building blocks and will have removable seats. The stadium will be capable of being reassembled or turned into multiple smaller venues.","Ras Abu Aboud's modular design also means construction of the venue will require fewer materials, create less waste and reduce the carbon footprint of the building process. Thanks to this sustainable approach to the stadium's construction, Ras Abu Aboud will receive a four-star Global Sustainability Assessment System certification. Qatar is delivering superb results in terms of sustainability, including the proposed design for Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, said Federico Addiechi, FIFA's Head of Sustainability & Diversity. From day one, there has been a strong emphasis on sustainability from Qatar, including a commitment to ensure that all infrastructure meets strict design, build and operations criteria under the GSAS certification programme. GSAS is the most far reaching green building certification. In addition to design and build, it also measures operations. This has actually informed the 2026 FIFA World Cup bidding process. Bidders are now required to adhere to all three steps regarding new developments, while existing buildings should be operated according to agreed sustainability guidelines. The 40,000-seat venue is slated for completion in 2020 and will be located in a 450,000m2 waterfront site on Doha's shore, where the use of shipping containers as one of the main building blocks will echo the nearby port. The stadium precinct, meanwhile, will offer exceptional views over Doha's landmark Corniche and into the downtown West Bay area, making it an ideal location for a waterfront development after the tournament and ensuring a vibrant local legacy. Its design also reinforces Qatar's commitment to leaving a physical legacy proportionate to Qatar's needs after the tournament, while heralding a new era of sustainable tournament infrastructure that can broaden the range of countries able to host such mega-events. The launch of the design of Ras Abu Aboud Stadium follows the design launch of Al Thumama Stadium in August 2017 and the completion of Khalifa International Stadium for the Emir Cup Final 2017 in May Ras Abu Aboud Stadium is one of eight proposed host venues for the World Cup.",http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2017/m=11/news=sc-launches-first-ever-fully-demountable-fifa-world-cuptm-stadium-2921118.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
55,1st-ever int'l football match was played on a cricket ground,"The first-ever official international football match was played between England and Scotland on the cricket ground of West of Scotland Cricket Club in Scotland's largest city Glasgow on November 30, 1872. As many as 4,000 spectators turned up for the match, which finished in a 0-0 draw. England played the match with a 1-1-8 formation while Scotland used 2-2-6.","18th November 2014, Celtic Park, Glasgow - Vauxhall International Challenge Match. 14th August 2013, Wembley Stadium, London - Teenage Cancer Trust Challenge Match. 17th November 1999, Wembley Stadium, London - Euro 2000 play-off 2nd leg. 13th November 1999, Hampden Park, Glasgow - Euro 2000 play-off 1st leg. 15th June 1996, Wembley Stadium, London - Euro '96. 27th May 1989, Hampden Park, Glasgow - Rous Cup. 23rd April 1986, Wembley Stadium, London - Rous Cup. 1872 First ever Auld Enemy clash. Scotland v England on the 30th November 1872 was the first time the sides met and was also the first ever official International football match. Fittingly, the match fell on St Andrew's Day and the venue was the West of Scotland cricket club's ground at Hamilton Crescent in Partick. All of Scotland's players were from Queen's Park FC, selected by captain and goalkeeper Robert W Gardner. England's players were selected from nine different clubs by captain Charles Alcock, though he was unable to play on the day due to injury. Special trains and horsedrawn cabs were provided to cope with the large crowd. The match was played under English rules and one of the more successful tactics employed by the English team was their one handed hurl used at throw ins. On a number of occasions Charles Campbell had to clear his defensive lines by heading out the long throws. The assured combination play of the Scots backed by a strong wind created a four goal lead at half time, but with both teams changing ends it was expected that England would come back into the match. To the surprise of most Scotland managed to dominate the early exchanges and added to their lead. England came into the match late on and managed to score two goals but even the loss of the Rangers full back Tom Vallance through injury could do little to affect the final result. A rain-soaked Wembley Stadium was the setting for one of the all time great Scotland v England fixtures. Despite an early scare when English forward Billy Smith hit the post, Scotland were in an attacking mood and Alex Jackson headed the opener after just three minutes. A resolute performance by the opposition rearguard prevented the visitors from adding to their tally, nevertheless they couldn't hold on and Alex James scored the second just before half time with a left foot strike. Scotland raised their game in the second half, dominating play and undoing their opponents with sublime skill and excellent teamwork, inevitably leading to a third goal scored by Jackson, again with his head. A fourth followed soon after, Alex James netting his second with the team seemingly able to score at will. As the end of the game drew closer, Alex Jackson completed his hat-trick. To the credit of the England players, they didn't give up and Bob Kelly scored a consolation from a free-kick, leaving the final score England 1, Scotland 5. As the final whistle sounded, both sets of fans showed their appreciation for the football they had witnessed and the legendary performance of Scotland that day that saw them dubbed the 'Wembley Wizards'. At the 1937 fixture between Scotland and England a new world record for attendance at a football match was officially set at 149,415, though the unofficial attendance is thought to be higher. The record stood until the 1950 World Cup Final surpassed it, yet it remains a European record to this day. The match itself was a successful one for Scotland, comprehensively beating England 3-1. Bob McPhail scored twice and Francis O'Donnell once for the Scots with Fred Steele scoring for the English. The Scots had lost 9-3 at Wembley the year before, and had not won an 'official' international against England at Hampden since 1937. An early goal by Davy Wilson of Rangers settled the nerves, and a penalty in the last few minutes by Eric Caldow, also of Rangers, saw off the English challenge. This was a good period for the Scottish team, between 1960 and 1964 they lost only one international at Hampden and won 12. The clash with England at Wembley in 1967 is undoubtedly Scotland's most famous victory over the Auld Enemy. It was less than a year since England had been crowned World Champions and they went into this game on the back of a 19 match unbeaten run. Featuring four of Celtic's legendary 'Lisbon Lions' as well as the likes of Jim Baxter, Denis Law and Billy Bremner, Scotland were still considered massive underdogs for the game. Denis Law opened the scoring after 27 minutes, bundling the ball home from a rebounded shot by Willie Wallace. Bobby Lennox doubled the advantage on 78 minutes before Jack Charlton, moved to centre forward after sustaining an injury early on, clawed one back for England five minutes before full time. Three minutes later, debutant Jim McCalliog scored to make it 3-1 to the Scots, however Geoff Hurst hit back immediately to make it 3-2. Famously, as the match drew to a close, Rangers legend Jim Baxter slowed to a walking pace and began playing 'keepie uppie', tormenting England and their support. The amazing victory led fans to playfully dub Scotland the 'unofficial world champions'. Euro 2000 Qualifications - 2nd Leg of play-off. On the day of Craig Browns sixth anniversary at the helm of Scotland, Wembley witnessed an epic encounter as the Scots launched a furious fight back in seeking to overturn England's 2-0 first-leg advantage. England did not manage a single shot on target in the entire 90 minutes, as Scotland rocked England onto the back foot as they out fought the home side in every department. England appeared blown apart by the ferocity of the Scotland onslaught, and on the 39th minute a cross from winger Neil McCann was met by Hutchinson's head and sent into the net to send the Tartan Army into delirium. The Scots deserved to take the tie to extra time as they poured forward, and had it not been for England keeper Seaman who came to the rescue pulling of a fantastic point-blank save from Christian Dailly's header with ten minutes to go, they surely would have. The Scottish fans broke into a spontaneous rendition of Flower of Scotland in a final bid to inspire their side, however, Scotland were once again left to claim a moral victory as the solo goal from Don Hutchison left them unable to overturn England's two-goal first-leg advantage.",http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/image_gallery.cfm?utm_campaign=awesummly&page=3125&utm_source=awesummly
56,Ashwin not as attacking off-spinner as Harbhajan was: Hayden,"Former Australian batsman Matthew Hayden has said that though Ravichandran Ashwin's statistics are ""simply phenomenal"", he is not as attacking off-spinner as Harbhajan Singh was. He further said that Ashwin enjoys a better fast bowling support than what Harbhajan used to get. ""Harbhajan I thought in his era was 'the dominant bowler' especially against Australia,"" Hayden added. ","Former Australia cricket team opener Matthew Hayden feels Ravichandran Ashwin's stats are simply phenomenal but Harbhajan Singh in his prime had to shoulder more responsibility since he did not have the fast bowling support which the Tamil Nadu tweaker gets. Ravichandran Ashwin broke Dennis Lillee's record to become the fastest bowler to 300 wickets in 54 Test matches during the second Test agains Sri Lanka cricket team in Nagpur earlier this week. I think stats often lie but having said that, some of the milestone show remarkable respect to Ravichandran Ashwin, who is fastest to 300 wickets in Test cricket. Even if he (Ashwin) plays for another five years, he would be remembered as one of the greats of his generation. His skill-set, like Harbhajan, is masterful but he is probably not as attacking off-spinner as Harbhajan was, Hayden said. He put the comparison in context by taking into account the kind of bowling attacks these two had for support. But then Ashwin doesn't really need to be as attacking as Bhajji. His role within this side is well-defined by a slightly better fast bowling attack than what my generation was facing. You line-up Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav and put Jasprit Bumrah into the mix with Jadeja as the second spinner as well. So Ashwin is playing his role and doing it successfully, Hayden explained. Harbhajan I thought in his era was 'the dominant bowler' especially against Australia so if Bhajji wasn't taking wickets, India were in trouble. I don't think Venkatesh Prasad was a wonderful Test match bowler. I think Harbhajan was the lone role maker. With due respect, Zaheer Khan or Javagal Srinath were wonderful bowlers but I think they were less of a threat compared to guys that are there now, Hayden said. However, when asked to compare Virat Kohli and Steve Smith, the former opener with more than 8000 Test runs and 30 hundreds said that both are destined for greatness in their own way. Kohli, Smith, Joe Root and Kane Williamson are vastly different players and good thing about all these guys is that each one of them is stepping on greatness in their own unique ways along with Cheteshwar Pujara and his 'Rahul Dravid like approach' to Test cricket, the burly Queenslander said. Williamson's backfoot play and ability to play the ball late in all conditions is something we haven't seen in modern players. Kohli's cover drive and ability to attack bowlers with quality running between the wickets and the manner in which he plays spin is unique. Now come to Smith with his unorthodox back-and-across type of approach - with that technique you might say he should not have achieved anywhere near what he is. The reality is that High Performance coaches should understand that there is not one right technique, most of it is between your left and right ear. These guys are great players as in their heads, they have got it spot on. Quiz him on an imaginary battle between Kohli and Glenn McGrath's probing off-stump line, Hayden said, he would have found a way I think like all great players do. You can cast shadow over technique and everyone has their own flaws but reality is that they overcome those deficiencies with application and commitment. So Kohli would have done fine against Glenn I think. Kohli has had his share of struggles in the English conditions and Hayden feels that he can connect with Kohli because England was one country where he never found his mojo until his last tour when he got a century at the Oval. Having a moderate season in conditions like England might have been a good thing for Virat. He has learnt probably what he has to do next time round. I was in same boat as well as I was scoring 1000 runs in County cricket in England but during Test matches, I had a certain role to play. Well, it didn't get me results in England, right through my career. It was one venue where I battled a bit because I too had an attacking strategy like Virat. He loves to hit the ball like all Indian players do. But in England, you have to leave the balls, build runs and hence wise the Pujaras or the Rahanes do well because, they leave a lot of deliveries. It's a different mindset, he said.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-vs-sri-lanka-2017/ravichandran-ashwin-has-better-pacer-support-than-harbhajan-matthew-hayden/story-iOsE9pja2K1jaCycEvIUFI.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

The former Australian all-rounder shared an image on Twitter, wherein he was seen giving batting tips to the wrestler and captioned it, ""Awesome day with @JohnCena. Only the best bats for this champion!""","WWE superstar John Cena appears to have found a mentor in Australian all-rounder Shane Watson as the former tried his hand at the gentleman's game during a recent trip to Sydney. Cena, who is currently Down Under to promote his upcoming film 'Ferdinand', certainly found his cricket experience to be a challenging one. The 16-time WWE Champion took to Twitter to share his experience of learning the ropes in a sport that isn't so commonly played in the United States of America (USA). Watson, who took up the job of aiding the wrestling champ in his bid to master the game, also shared an image of the two. Despite Cena's lack of faith in his cricketing abilities, Australia's Big Bash League outfit Sydney Thunders was confident that he could hit a few big ones.

""We have faith in the blokes to do the right thing,"" Lehmann added. His statement comes after England cricket chief Andrew Strauss slapped a curfew on players following England's loss in the first Test.","Australia cricket team coach Darren Lehmann on Wednesday said he won't be imposing any curfews on his players throughout the rest of the Ashes series. Lehmann took a dig at England by saying that the Aussies are adults and that he has full faith in his players to do the right thing. We wouldn't have curfews but that's our decision and that is theirs. They're grown men, they're adults, he told reporters in Adelaide. Lehmann's statement comes after England cricket chief Andrew Strauss slapped a curfew on his players restricting them from going out after midnight, in the wake of Jonny Bairstow's alleged headbutt on Australian opener Cameron Bancroft earlier this month. These guys are not thugs, Strauss said. These are good, honest, hard-working cricketers who sacrifice a lot to play for England. We've got to take steps to make sure that reality is what people perceive of the England cricket team, not something different. I think there's a bit of naivety there and I think we need to be smarter, the Guardian quoted Strauss as saying. Meanwhile, Lehmann also reckons that the Adelaide Oval, which will host the second Ashes Test against England, would be the fastest pitch in the country under lights. It's a fascinating Test match, there's a lot of talk about it'll seam and it'll swing, Lehmann said on Tuesday as the teams travelled from Brisbane to Adelaide. The ball stays pretty good, but you can make runs if you play well as per normal. And it does quicken up at night - probably the fastest wicket around Australia at night, so that's going to be interesting, how it plays, Lehmann was quoted by espncricinfo. Saying that the Aussies will attack England's middle and lower order, Lehmann also pointed out that short deliveries will work to the hosts' advantage as grounds here are bigger than in England. Certainly hasn't changed from four years ago. It's a bit different in Australia than England where grounds are smaller and you can't really get away with it, on bigger grounds you can. So that's one for us that we see as an advantage. They did it quite a lot to us as well, it's a ploy a lot of people do now. At the back end when the wicket quickened up and we could go after them a bit harder was helpful. That's the blueprint, it's no secret we're going to attack their middle and lower order like that, Lehmann said.",http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/the-ashes-england-curfew-australia-coach-darren-lehmann-test-cricket/1/1099429.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

Dhankar said desi cow's milk not only makes one beautiful but also sharpens the mind. He said monetary awards are given to everyone, but these girls deserved something unique for making Haryana proud at such a young age. The boxing championship was held in Guwahati between 19 and 26 November. Neetu and Sakshi of Haryana's Bhiwani, Jyoti of Rohtak and Shashi of Hisar won gold medals each, while Anupama of Palwal and Neha of Kaithal won bronze medals in various categories.

He said the government will soon organise a film festival in Haryana featuring all the movies made on sports so thath others could take inspiration from sports achievers of the state.

61,I should have retired after Phillip Hughes' death: Clarke,"Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has said that he should have retired after the death of his friend and teammate Phillip Hughes on November 27, 2014. ""My career should have stopped then. It was too hard for me,"" he added. Clarke revealed that he cried himself to sleep every night during Australia's tour of Windies in 2015. ","Former Australia captain Michael Clarke says he should have retired a year earlier than he did, admitting he struggled badly after the death of his friend and teammate Phillip Hughes. Clarke quit in 2015 after his 115th and final Test of the Ashes series against England and said he didn't allow himself to grieve at the time. Hughes, who played 26 Tests, died from bleeding on the brain in November 2014 after being hit on the neck by a rising ball while batting in a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground. I shouldn't have played another game. My career should have stopped then. It was too hard for me, Clarke told The Weekly Review on Thursday. It took me a lot longer to grieve his loss than it should have, or that I would have liked. I didn't allow myself to grieve at the time because I had responsibility to his family, firstly, but then also as Australia's cricket captain to my teammates and getting us back out onto the field. Clarke, who was a pallbearer at Hughes' funeral and delivered an emotional eulogy to his little brother, said that after he died, he felt fear for the first time while playing cricket. Clarke toured the West Indies in June 2015, which he said was a mistake. Going to the West Indies was probably the worst tour of my life in regards to how emotional I was, he said. I was there on my own. Unfortunately Kyly couldn't come because she was pregnant and we weren't comfortable with her flying. I had six weeks in the West Indies. Whatever we had on as a team during the day I would go back to my room every night and just cry myself to sleep. He said there were days when the pain of missing Hughes was still raw. I still have days regularly where it's heart-breaking. The emotion and pain is still there. Since his retirement, Clarke has commentated on cricket for Australia's Nine Network. He also runs his own cricket academy among other business interests.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/michael-clarke-feels-he-should-have-retired-after-phil-hughes-died/story-rFCvkTxcolih7aRL85HLJN.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
62,Why politicise cricket by not playing Pakistan: Bishan Bedi,"Ex-India captain Bishan Singh Bedi has said one should not ""narrow down the meaning of patriotism"" by politicising bilateral cricketing relationship with Pakistan. ""Why politicise cricket? Have you been able to wipe off terrorism by not playing cricket? Cricket is a platform to come closer,"" Bedi added. He further said Indian team should wear national logo instead of BCCI logo.","Former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi feels that one should not narrow down the meaning of patriotism by politicising bilateral cricketing relationship with Pakistan. The Indian government has not given any go-ahead to Indo-Pak bilateral series since the last one was held in India in 2012. Since then, India have played against Pakistan only in ICC events. Cricket is a platform to come closer, Bedi, whose penchant for plain speaking is legendary, told PTI during an interaction on the sidelines of an annual DDCA Conclave. Asked if patriotism in the current social scenario is intrinsically linked to being anti-Pakistan, one of the finest left-arm spinners of all time, said: This is not right. I am not talking anti-India if I am asking for a cricket series with Pakistan. One of the staunchest critics of BCCI, Bedi wants the word 'control' to be removed from 'Board of Control for Cricket in India' as it stinks of autocratic, dictatorial mindset. The national logo has to be worn by the Indian team and not the BCCI logo. I am very clear in my mind. The players are not playing for BCCI but are playing for India. New Zealand and Australia have national emblems. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh wear national emblems. Indian Cricket Board (ICB) or Cricket India should be the name, said the 71-year-old. Bedi also questioned the context of a series like the one India is currently playing against Sri Lanka, which is turning out to be a virtual no contest. We are just playing them time and again. We thrashed them in their backyard and now we are thrashing them here also. At least let's have some contest. Had this Sri Lanka tour not happened, the boys would have played Ranji Trophy. May be had a camp also for preparation before going to South Africa.

63,Perera to be 5th captain this year to lead SL ODI team,"All-rounder Thisara Perera has been named Sri Lanka's captain for the upcoming ODI series against India. Perera replaces Upul Tharanga, under whom Sri Lanka lost 15 out of 17 ODIs this year. Perera will also become the fifth captain to lead Sri Lanka in ODIs this year, with others being Angelo Mathews, Chamara Kapugedera and Lasith Malinga.","Sri Lanka have named all-rounder Thisara Perera as their captain ahead of their three-match ODI series against India. Perera, who takes over the reins from Upul Tharanga, is also expected to lead the visitors in the three T20 internationals scheduled after the ODIs. Sri Lanka have faced somewhat of a crisis in the past year with whitewashes at the hands of South Africa, Pakistan and India at home. Notably, Dinesh Chamdimal was anointed as captain of the Test side after Mathews had decided to step down after the dismal showing in the ICC Champions Trophy. The decision to appoint Tharanga had surprised many in the first place, and the whitewashes under the opening batsman didn't help his claim to captaincy. Upul Tharanga and former captain Angelo Mathews (right) have not been successful as Sri Lankan captains. (REUTERS) The left-handed Tharanga's form with the bat may have been plentiful, with over 800 runs in 22 ODIs at an average of 47 with two centuries and five half-centuries in 2017, but running into trouble due to slow over rates had also led to his suspension. It was Tharanga's decision to sit out of Sri Lanka's last T20 against Pakistan last month that had given Perera his first taste of captaincy. As reported by Cricbuzz, Angelo Mathews was in running to resume as captain against India but his prolonging injuries ruled him out. Chandimal, too, was considered but his poor running in the limited over formats sidelined him. The three one-day games against India are on December 10 in Dharamsala, December 13 in Chandigarh and December 17 in Visakhapatnam.

64,Nehru was against Somnath Temple where Rahul prayed: PM Modi,"Slamming Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's visit to Gujarat's Somnath Temple, PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday said Gandhi's great grandfather and former PM Jawaharlal Nehru was not happy with the idea of the temple being built. Asking if Gandhi had forgotten his family's history, PM Modi credited late Home Minister Sardar Patel for the construction of the temple. ","With voting for the Gujarat Assembly election just days away, campaigning for the polls is in high gear. Today saw a number of high-profile rallies with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi both in the state. The Somnath temple in Gujarat's Saurashtra region was at the centre of attention with Gandhi and PM Modi attending events within 50 kilometers of each other. The two, however, did not have a literal face-off - while Rahul attended a darshan at the Somnath temple and PM Modi spoke at a rally in a town around 20 kms away. The PM, however, used Rahul's presence in the vicinity of his rally site to launch a attack on the Nehru-Gandhi family. Congress will waive farmers' loans within 10 days, says Rahul Gandhi in Amreli. Congress leaders said a controversial signature in a Somnath temple register meant for non-Hindu visitors which was thought to be Rahul Gandhi's, wasn't made by him. Modi addressed a rally in Navsari. Modi says that as Chief Minister, he pleaded with the Congress to get the Narmada project moving, but in vain. They hate development, they hate Gujarat, they hate Modi and now they hate sweat also. That is because they have never had to sweat it out in life and work hard. They are mocking everyone who works hard. Such hatred for the poor is shocking, he said. PM Modi is addressing a rally in Palitana. He blamed a water shortage that used to exist in the region on the Congress, and said the BJP had changed this. At the rally in Prachi, PM Modi attacked Congress over OBC quotas, saying the party had failed to ensure constitutional status for the OBC Comission when it was in power, and One-Rank-One-Pension. The demand for OROP was pending for forty long years. READ: Gujarat Assembly election: Why chaiwala jibe at Narendra Modi may have put Congress on back foot. If there was no Sardar Patel, the temple in Somnath would never have been possible, PM Modi continued. When Dr Rajendra Prasad was to come to inaugurate the Somnath Temple, Pandit Nehru expressed his displeasure. Sardar Patel dreamt about the Narmada but your family did not let that dream fulfill. At his second rally in Prachi, a town near the iconic Somnath temple, PM Modi continued his attack on the Nehru-Gandhi family. Your family members, our first PM (Jawarharlal Nehru; Rahul Gandhi's great-grandafather was not happy with the idea of a temple being built there. Today's rallies and events come just over a week before the first phase of voting in the Gujarat election. The first round of voting will take place on December 9 for 89 assembly seats while the remaining 93 constituencies will vote on December 14. Meanwhile, Hardik Patel too held a 'jansabha' in Morbi. In a tweet, the firebrand Patidar leader said he addressed farmers in Morbi. During his first rally in Gujarat's Morbi, PM Modi attacked the Gandhi family, and talked about the development work the BJP government in Gujarat has carried out. Will you take another 45 years to fulfil the promise, Rahul asked in his tweet addressed to PM Modi. Meanwhile, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi once again attacked PM Modi on Twitter. Gandhi took aim at the BJP, claiming the party promised 50 lakh houses for the poor in Gujarat during the last election, but constructed only 4.72 lakh units. The Prime Minister, however, will not be going to the Somnath temple, with sources saying this was due to Rahul Gandhi's scheduled visit to the iconic religious site.",http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/gujarat-election-campaigning-2017-live-somnath-rahul-gandhi-narendra-modi/1/1099390.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

The temple maintains a register at the entrance where non-Hindu visitors are required to declare their identity. Congress said the picture of Gandhi's signature in the non-Hindu register was fake and blamed the BJP for diverting from real issues.,"So when Rahul Gandhi signed up as a non-Hindu at the Somnath temple register, it became an issue. In what was apparently a goof-up, Congress president-in-waiting and pat's chief campaigner in Gujarat was listed as a non-Hindu at the temple he visited on Wednesday morning. All non-Hindus have to declare their identity at the temple. There is an image that is going viral on Twitter that shows Rahul Gandhi's name in a register. Below it is Ahmed Patel's name. This image - These two names - that of Rahul Gandhi and Ahmed Patel - were found in the register maintained for non-Hindus visiting the Somnath temple. Senior journalist Brajesh K Singh's tweet about the issue sheds light into what exactly happened at the Somnath Temple. In his tweet, Singh said, his media coordinator Manoj Tyagi mentioned Rahul Gandhi(Gandhi's) name along with Ahmed Patel(Patel's) into the spl (sic) register maintained for Non-Hindus who are visiting the temple. Major goof up in the election season(sic). It's quite obvious that Rahul Gandhi would not address himself as Rahul Gandhi Ji. It is also clear from the image that the same person has written down both Rahul's and Patel's names. Sensing the importance of the matter, Congress' media coordinator Manoj Tyagi has issued a statement. In the statement, Tyagi said, I entered just my name in the register to take media personnel inside the Somanth Temple.

""We do not want to commercialise this thing. We don't want to do 'dalali' (wheeling-dealing) over it,"" Gandhi added. He further claimed BJP workers had deliberately entered his name on a register meant for non-Hindu visitors at the Somnath temple.","A day after a controversy broke out over his religion, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said he and his family members were 'Shiv Bhakts' but asserted that he did not want to use his religion for political gains. Addressing traders in a closed-door meeting here, Gandhi said he did not need anybody's certificate about his religion, nor would he do 'dalali' (deal) over religion. My grandmother and my family are Shiv Bhakts. But we keep such things private. We generally do not speak about them. Because, we think it is a very personal matter and we don't need anyone else's certificate about it, he said. We do not want to commercialise this thing. We don't want to do 'dalali' over it. A video of his interaction was shared with the media by local Congress leaders. I will tell you what had happened (yesterday). Then I signed the visitors' book. After that, BJP people wrote my name in the second book, Gandhi alleged. On the relationship between Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru, Gandhi said they were friends despite some political and ideological differences. Though they were friends and even went to jail together, some people here are spreading lies that they were enemies. Further, there is evidence that Sardar Patel was against the RSS. But some people here are spreading a lie that he was RSS sympathiser, which is not true, he said. Gandhi's visit to the Somnath temple yesterday got mired in a controversy after his name, along with that of Ahmed Patel, was found written on the entry register meant for non- Hindus, with the Congress calling it fake and the BJP insisting the leader declare his religious faith before people. Gujarat Congress president Bharatsinh Solanki hinted that BJP president Amit Shah, who is a trustee of the temple, could be behind it. You know what he is capable of. They have stooped to such a low level that now they want to term us non-Hindus, Solanki said today. Rahul Gandhi had just written in the visitors' book that it is an 'inspiring place'. That was a clear conspiracy, Solanki said. The temple administration said Gandhi's name was written in the shrine's register for non-Hindus by his media coordinator, and its staff was not involved in the episode. Non-Hindus are allowed to visit the temple but have to first get themselves registered at the shrine's office. The signatures against their names were that of the Congress party's media coordinator, Manoj Tyagi.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/my-family-is-shiv-bhakt-won-t-do-dalali-over-religion-asserts-rahul-gandhi/story-qmIbcr2w3Dw3IOl4C1q7BJ.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

The department claimed the party failed to account for the ₹13 crore it received from its overseas donors before the 2015 Delhi election.","The income-tax department has issued a Rs 30-crore notice to the Aam Aadmi party (AAP) for allegedly violating norms on collecting donations, including hawala entries worth Rs 2 crore. The order for tax assessment issued this November 23 sought the party's explanation by December 7, saying it incorrectly disclosed hawala money as voluntary donations. The AAP said the order was bogus and accused the people who run the country of muzzling the voice of Delhi's ruling party. The reference was to the BJP-led government at the Centre, with whom the AAP has a running dispute over administrative control of Delhi. The income-tax department declared all donations to the AAP in 2014-2015 as illegal, revoking tax exemptions given to it as a political party. The order came with the penalty notice for allegedly concealing its correct income, news agency PTI reported. The party has also been charged with not correctly reporting political donations received by it as stipulated under the Representation of the People Act. Tax officials said the AAP was given 34 opportunities to explain its overseas donations, especially around Rs 13.16 crore it received from supporters from overseas before the 2015 Delhi elections. The party allegedly did not disclose before the Election Commission details of Rs 6.26 crore donated by 461 donors - each donation exceeding Rs 20,000 - during the election campaign. It has been alleged that details of donations worth Rs 36.95 crore were not uploaded online and the party did not declare Rs 29.13 crore in documents submitted to the poll panel. The AAP's total taxable income for 2014-2015 was Rs 68.44 crore, according to the tax notice. The corresponding income tax was pegged at Rs 30.67 crore. Delhi chief minister and AAP national convenor, Arvind Kejriwal, responded to the notice as a case of political vendetta. All these were accounted for and shown in books of accounts, Kejriwal said in a tweet. AAP treasurer Deepak Bajpai called it a malicious attempt to target the party, though each penny that we get is accounted for.

69,Rahul said Hindu terror bigger threat than LeT: Law Minister,"Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has alleged that Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi had officially told US Ambassador Timothy Roemer that Hindu terrorism was a bigger threat than the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Prasad was quoting a UK-based newspaper report, which had used WikiLeaks documents as a source. Report also said Gandhi was referring to then Gujarat CM Narendra Modi, he added.","Taking forward Narendra Modi's attack on Rahul Gandhi that the Congress compromises with national interest, Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said Rahul Gandhi had officially told the US Ambassador Timothy Roemer that Hindu terrorism were a bigger threat than the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). And this is just within few months of the Mumbai terror attack. The report also says that Rahul was referring to then BJP chief minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi who he described as a polarising figure, he added. The newspaper report, shared by Prasad in a presser in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, is based on a leaked cable by WikiLeaks. 'The cable contained details of Rahul's conversation with the envoy at a luncheon hosted by Prime Minsiter Manmohan Singh at his residence in July 2009 in honour of visiting US secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Responding to the ambassador's query about Lashkar-e-Taiba's activities in the region and immediate threat to India, Rahul said there was evidence of some support for the group among certain elements in India's indigenous Muslim community. Another issue Prasad raised was that then Prime Minister of Congress, Manmohan Singh also compromised on national interest in Sharm-el-Sheikh in July 2009. Flashing a joint statement released by the government at the time, Prasad outlined, Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Balochistan and other areas. Repeating Modi's allegation that Congress and Rahul Gandhi had insulted the Indian Army by questioning the surgical strikes as 'Khoon ki Saudagari', Prasad said, Under the brave and fearless leadership of Narendra Modi, we have empowered the Indian Army. And you can see that in the last few years, no new LeT terrorist stays alive for very long. What is the Congress's actual plan to cross the 50% cap on reservation. There are six orders of Supreme Court, four of them by five judge Bench each and one of an eight judge bench that has categorically refuted it. A document shared by him says in the Nagraja Vs UOI 2006 (8) SCC 212; Para 110 also states that a law can be challenged when reservation goes upto 50%, the court would take them up. Subsequently and states very specifically that even if the state has reasons for such reservation but goes against the cap it is liable to be set aside. Launching another attack on Congress for ignoring Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, he said, We never said Sardar Patel was our leader. We are just questioning your treatment of him. Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, members of the Nehru Gandhi family were prime ministers of the country for 40 years after Sardar's death.

That's Salman Khan for the uninitiated. In a free-wheeling conversation at the 15th Hindustan Times Leadership Summit, Khan said it was only journalists who made his life sound interesting. During the final session of Day 1 at the summit, the actor was at his witty best despite a sore throat. Everyone here must have led a better life than me. I have been working 24 hours since the age of 15. I have slept in cars because there were no vanity vans and only worked all my life, Khan said, downplaying his larger-than-life image.

When asked if Padmavati's director Sanjay Leela Bhansali is capable of hurting anyone's sentiments, Khan joked, Bhansali has offended me. I gave him two hit films, and then he took Shah Rukh Khan in his next film. Khan ended the session on a philosophical note, taking a dig at himself, when asked about how he deals with failures.

Mine isn’t: Atul on Padmavati row,"While speaking about the protests over Sanjay Leela Bhansali directorial 'Padmavati', producer-photographer Atul Kasbekar said, ""Why did this become religious? Is your God so vulnerable? Mine isn't!"" ""If you have a problem with the subject or the film, do not watch it,"" added Atul. He further said that Padmavati is essentially a fictitious character.","Reacting to wide-spread protests against Deepika Padukone-Ranveer Singh-starrer Padmavati, Kasbekar says, We have reached Andy moment. All of these people (protesters) are getting their 15 minutes of fame. It is baffling that the character of Padmavati is essentially a fictitious character. This is the equivalent of us being worked upon Illiad. Now if I call them up one month later and ask them to narrate the incidents, every person will have a different version and no one will remember exact details of everything. And this is just one month I am talking about, and in the age of selfies and videos, etc With Padmavati, we are talking about hundreds of years ago! Kasbekar has produced Vidya Balan's Tumhari Sulu and Sonam Kapoor's Neerja. Riding high on the success of Tumhari Sulu, he talks about the new-wave of content-driven cinema in Hindi films. There are very difficult times as the audience is on the lookout for new content. Each film has its own journey. It was purely coincidental that the scripts happened to be women-centric, he says. It is the core of my being, It gives me the most, almost like meditative space for me. Otherwise, people say I have the attention span of a grasshopper but when I am shooting, I am all there. I tell my kids, do what no one asks you do and then do it for a living, you will be fine. Further talking about the importance of writing in films, the producer says, Something like Neerja, could attract Fox Studios only because of the compelling script it had. Same with Sulu, it is like a modern-day homage to Hrishikesh Mukherjee films, with very relatable characters. At the first level, it is just the script which guides what films I choose. Secondly, I need to back my captain, I need to see the directors' vision. Someone like Ram Madhav (Neerja) he had every single detail etched out, during the narration, he did voices of different characters! Such understanding also works as a bonus. Talking about his future projects, Atul says, There's a bunch of different things. There are two digital series - a musical with Amazon and the other one is with Netflix. We also have hopefully two movies that will go to floors soon.",http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/is-your-god-so-vulnerable-mine-isn-t-atul-kasbekar-on-padmavati-protests/story-uOXD1LlzVUWT6doE8Ff45O.html?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
87,Sexy Barbie Girl' song cleared after Barbie changed to baby,"The song 'Sexy Barbie Girl' from the Arbaaz Khan and Sunny Leone starrer 'Tera Intezaar' has been cleared by the Delhi High Court after the word 'Barbie' was replaced with 'baby'. The film's makers were sued by Mattel Inc, the manufacturer of Barbie dolls for using the word 'Barbie' in the song without the company's permission.","The Barbie controversy got resolved without any drama today with the film makers voluntarily agreeing to replace the word Barbie appearing in the Sunny Leone starrer song 'Sexy Barbie Girl' with Baby. When asked by the court about what prompted this decision, since there was no stay in the matter, the lawyer appearing for the film makers submitted to the court that they wanted to put this needless controversy to an end without having to go through multiple rounds of unending litigation. T-Series, who was also made a party to this dispute, submitted through their lawyers that they had merely purchased the music rights in the songs of the film under a written agreement and were delivered the song by the film makers in its current form. They argued that neither the use of the word Barbie nor showing the idea of a woman dressed as Barbie as part of the song could be said to be unlawful. They told the court that without getting into the legal issues raised in the matter, if the film makers were themselves willing to make changes in the song at their own end without conceding to any infringement of copyright, they had no objection to use the edited song instead. The Delhi High Court accordingly disposed of the suit, recording the statements given by the defendants and allowed the film's release to go ahead as scheduled. The Court also asked the film makers to take expedited steps to approach CBFC in this regard and get the edited version re-certified for further use.",http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/court-clears-t-series-song-sexy-barbie-girl-makers-change-barbie-baby/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
88,"Benchmark, Menlo intend to sell Uber shares: SoftBank","SoftBank has confirmed that it received indication from Uber's early investors Benchmark, Menlo Ventures, and others of their intent to sell shares in the cab-hailing startup. Benchmark owns 13% of the startup worth nearly $9 billion, according to SoftBank. Earlier, reports suggested that SoftBank-led team of investors has offered to buy Uber shares at 30% less than its current value.","SoftBank Group has confirmed that it has found likely sellers for the tender offer for Uber's shares, which launched tonight. These are the shares from existing shareholders that will be sold at more than a 30% discount to Uber's last private round. The Japanese investment firm provided us with the following statement. SoftBank and Dragoneer have received indications from Benchmark, Menlo Ventures, and other early investors of their intent to sell shares in the tender offer. Any sales by these shareholders will be pursuant to the same terms and conditions as will be offered to all other eligible holders that participate in the tender offer. As we reported earlier, the share price SoftBank is presently offering is $32.96, which is beneath the $48.77 per share that Uber was last valued at in its Series G round last year. The new value is under $50 billion. We've also reported that Sequoia is looking to invest in the tender round, alongside TPG and Tencent. And with SoftBank and Dragoneer, the combined investors could buy up to $8 billion in Uber shares. The tender offer is supposed to last for 20 business days. SoftBank could later raise the share price if they do not find enough sellers. And while SoftBank is publicly confirming that Benchmark and Menlo Ventures intend to sell shares, we're hearing that they may be doing a little bit of negotiating through the press. These venture firms are likely sellers, but have not formally agreed to the latest share price. There is also a planned direct investment of $1 billion into Uber, that is expected to happen at the last private valuation of nearly $70 billion. The secondary transaction and the primary transaction are a package deal. Benchmark and Menlo are amongst Uber's largest shareholders. Benchmark, which has a board seat, has also been involved in a lawsuit against former Uber CEO, Travis Kalanick. This lawsuit pertains to Kalanick's power to appoint three board seats, including his own. If the deal goes through, Benchmark has agreed to drop the lawsuit, so long as Kalanick gets board approval for future board appointments. Kalanick has already appointed John Thain and Ursula Burns to these roles. Kalanick resigned in June, following months of negative publicity about the company's culture. The company has also been involved in a wave of lawsuits, particularly with Alphabet's self-driving car division, Waymo. The SoftBank investment would likely be the last private round before Uber does an IPO. The company has said that it hopes to join the stock market in 2019. It's a turning point for Uber shareholders, many of whom were unable to sell shares, due to the company's strict policies. Now accredited investors who have at least 10,000 shares will be eligible to sell. This, however, excludes employees and other investors who have less than $1 million in assets or make less than $200,000. While this is the standard requirement for buying shares, it's less common to have these rules for sellers. We reported a few weeks ago that the tender offer would kick off today. Part of the motivation to get the deal done was so that employees could turn paper riches into cash before the holidays.",https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/softbank-confirms-that-benchmark-and-menlo-will-be-selling-uber-shares/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

The Series B funding round also saw participation from existing investors including IDG Ventures. Founded in 2008, the startup offers voice and data technology to provide enterprise-services like banking, insurance, healthcare, education on mobile phones. ","Developing voice assistant and speech recognition solutions, Chennai-based IT startup Uniphore Software Systems has closed its series B round of funding led by the Executive Chairman of Cisco and the newly made US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), John Chambers, in his personal capacity. The round saw participation from other existing investors including IDG Ventures who led the previous round. This is the first startup-investment of Chambers outside the US. Earlier this year, John Chambers was also part of the top 20 American CEOs delegation invited by PM Modi, to invest in India. Uniphore will utilize these new funds to deepen core research driving product enhancement, upgrade its customer service infrastructure, expand its sales reach to newer geographies and recruit new talent to support its rapid growth. Commenting on the fundraise, Umesh Sachdev, cofounder and CEO of Uniphore Software Systems said, We are humbled by John's concurrence to be Chief Guru at Uniphore. It is our good fortune to have an industry veteran like John invest in the future of Uniphore. While John's monetary investment is certainly important to the company, it is his vast and varied experience building a globally leading IT company that adds incalculable value to Uniphore and I am certain that the company will gain immensely from his counsel and guidance. Founded by Ravi Saraogi and Umesh Sachdev in 2008, Uniphore is an IIT Chennai-incubated IT-startup developing solutions in speech analytics and virtual assistant verticals such as auMina and akeira. The startup has now its offices in Chennai, Bengaluru, Singapore and UAE. Speaking of the investment, John Chambers said, I am a big believer in India and its potential for producing globally relevant startups like Uniphore. The company was able to foresee the growing need for deep technology in the area of speech recognition and has innovated ahead of the market to capture this significant opportunity. During my time working with and mentoring Umesh, I have been impressed with his leadership and passion for improving customer experiences, and his ability to build a world-class team of software experts. While the speech analytics and virtual assistant verticals are estimated to touch $10 Bn by 2021 globally, with funds from John Chambers, Uniphore aims to establish an early lead in the segment.",https://inc42.com/buzz/john-chambers-chennai-startup-uniphore/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
90,FM Arun Jaitley formally launches Paytm Payments Bank,Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Tuesday formally launched the Paytm Payments Bank in New Delhi. The Payments Bank will have zero charges on all online transactions and no minimum balance requirement. It will also offer a 4-7% interest rate on savings account and a free personalised RuPay digital debit card.,"After launching the Airtel Payments Bank in January this year, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also formally inaugurated Paytm Payments Bank in the capital today. Speaking at the event, Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Founder and CEO of Paytm stated, India is at a cusp of a financial revolution. The demography and access to financial services will create a ton of jobs in the country and Paytm is very proud to be a part of this financial services revolution. Paytm Payments Bank will work towards creating a massive number of jobs in the long run. The bank will have zero charges on all online transactions and no minimum balance requirement and will offer free personalized RuPay digital debit card. It will also offer a 4-7% interest rate on savings account, and up to 7% on a linked sweep out Fixed Deposit. The company has planned an investment of $500 Mn in KYC operations. It is setting up KYC centers across India to complete KYC for customers and make them eligible for a Payments Bank account. Renu Satti, MD and CEO of Paytm Payments Bank added, Paytm Payments Bank is the country's largest mobile-first, technology-led bank. By virtue of reaching every nook and corner of the country, we will be able to bring the large un-served and under-served population to the mainstream economy. We are committed to offering the most transparent, safe and trusted banking to masses. Just last week, Paytm Payments bank had received yet another cash infusion from the parent company. Paytm's parent company One97 Communications and Vijay Shekhar Sharma together invested $18.84 Mn in Paytm Payments Bank. This takes their total infusion in the payments bank to $61.78 Mn. The fund infusion follows the September cash raise wherein the Payments Bank had reportedly secured $9.3 Mn from Sharma and other existing investors. The development came at a time when the firm was gearing up to launch its own debit card. Incorporated in August last year, the Payments Bank formally launched operations in May 2017. Between August 2016 and March 2017, it reported losses of around $4.6 Mn. According to its MCA filings, the firm saw a turnover of $378K during the said period. Currently, of the eleven entities which received in-principle licences to launch payment banks, only four are operational. These include India Post Payments Bank, Airtel Payments Bank, Fino Payments Bank and Paytm Payments Bank. But even with just four in the fray, these payment banks have not been able to attract too many deposits so far. A recent report in Bloomberg Quint, based on an RTI request to the RBI, showed that the four payments banks were slow in mobilising deposits and had outstanding demand deposits worth $36.52 Mn only as on September 30. Nevertheless, Vijay Shekhar Sharma had earlier stated his intentions to reach 500 Mn bank accounts by 2020. Given that the digital payments segment in India is poised to reach $500 Bn by 2020 according to a report by Google and Boston Consulting Group, it seems Paytm is all in to rake in a part of this pie through the Paytm Payments Bank despite early losses and slow mobilising customer deposits. Besides its commitment to KYC operations, this month, Paytm also tied up with ICICI Bank this month to offer short-term, interest-free credit line aptly called Paytm-ICICI Bank Postpaid to customers.",https://inc42.com/buzz/paytm-payments-bank-paytm/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

This is in addition to the $350 million funding SpaceX raised in July, which valued the startup at over $21 billion. Founded in 2002, SpaceX is backed by investors like Google, Fidelity Investments and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.","Elon Musk-led SpaceX has raised $100 million by selling shares, in an extension to a financing round earlier this year that raised up to $350 million, a regulatory filing showed on Monday.

92,Morgan Stanley marks up Flipkart valuation to $9.36 billion,"Financial services firm Morgan Stanley has marked up the valuation of e-commerce giant Flipkart to $9.36 billion for the quarter ended September. It comes after Flipkart's valuation was marked down to $7.9 billion by mutual fund investor Valic in its latest quarterly report. Flipkart had raised $2.4 billion from Japan's SoftBank at a valuation of $11.6 billion, earlier in August.","Morgan Stanley, one of its mutual fund investors, has marked up the valuation of homegrown ecommerce behemoth Flipkart to $9.36 Bn for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The markup came as Morgan Stanley marked up the value of its holdings in the company by 24.6% to $88.1 per share, compared to $70.7 for the three-month period ended June 2017. There has been a steady markup in the valuation of Flipkart by Morgan Stanley since December 2016. Last year, it had marked down the value of its holdings in Flipkart for consecutive quarters. In March this year, Morgan Stanley had marked down Flipkart's valuation for the fifth time in a row, pegging it at $5.37 Bn. But since the beginning of this year, the valuation has been steady at $70.7 per share for two quarters in a row. Interestingly, the valuation markup by Morgan Stanley was preceded by a valuation markdown by another of Flipkart's investor s- Valic. This was way below the $11.6 Bn valuation at which Flipkart raised funds earlier this year. However even the current valuation of $9.36 Bn stated by Morgan Stanley is also below the valuation at which it raised funds. Though technically Flipkart's latest fundraising was a down round from its peak valuation of $15 Bn, however the fundraise and endorsement by SoftBank was seen as a major victory for the ecommerce firm in its fight against rival Amazon India. Flipkart mostly doesn't agree with markdowns by mutual funds, with founders Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal repeatedly dismissing these markdowns terming them as theoretical exercises. But the fact remains that the current valuation of the ecommerce major is still way below its peak valuation was $15.2 billion in July 2015. This shows that some investors still feel that India's large consumer internet startups are overvalued. The markup by Morgan Stanley is also significant that now Amazon and Flipkart are involved in a very close battle for market position in India's ecommerce space. As per a recent Morgan Stanley report, the Indian ecommerce market will touch $200 Bn mark by 2027.",https://inc42.com/buzz/morgan-stanley-flipkart-valuation/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

94,"Sequoia, Tencent, TPG may invest in Uber alongside SoftBank","Venture capital firm Sequoia Capital is looking to increase its stake in app-based cab aggregator Uber alongside SoftBank, according to reports. The other investors on the list include China's Tencent and US-based venture capital firm TPG Growth. Earlier, the SoftBank-led investors reportedly valued Uber at about 30% less than its current value, aiming for a 14% ownership in the company.","It's not just SoftBank and Dragoneer that are looking to buy Uber shares from the employees and other shareholders when the tender offer launches, likely later today. Sources tell us that Sequoia Capital is looking to increase its stake in Uber this way. The other investors on the list include Tencent and TPG. SoftBank has made an offer to purchase the shares at $32.96. This is a steep discount to the $48.77 from the latest Series G round. The group of investors are looking to buy about $8 billion in shares. If they do not find enough sellers to meet the $8 billion, it's possible that they will increase the offer price. There's also a $1 billion direct investment in Uber, which would value the company at its last private valuation of nearly $70 billion. Sequoia has previously invested in Uber through its scout program, which involves covertly finding deal opportunities through its network. Alfred Lin, a partner in Sequoia, also made an angel investment at the seed stage. He previously lamented that Sequoia overlooked Uber. For many Uber shareholders, the secondary offering will give them the opportunity to turn paper riches into cash. These include current and former employees, venture capitalists and angel investors. But they're only eligible to sell if they have at least 10,000 shares. They also need to be accredited investors, which means that Uber employees who make less than $200,000 in salary will also need to have $1 million in assets. The $1 billion investment in Uber will also help the company continue to fuel its growth as it prepares to go public in 2019. This is a big moment for Uber, in what has otherwise been a very difficult year. Uber has had countless legal battles, including a patent lawsuit with Alphabet's self-driving car division. There's also been public outcry about its company culture. Co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick was pressured to step down in June. If the deal is completed, investor and board member Benchmark Capital plans to drop its lawsuit against Kalanick. The suit is related to Kalanick's power to appoint three board seats, including his own. Kalanick recently named Ursula Burns and John Thain to those seats. If one of them gives up their spot, Kalanick will require a board vote to appoint a replacement, as long as the SoftBank deal is finalized.",https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/28/sequoia-tencent-tpg-look-to-invest-in-uber-alongside-softbank/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

Founded in 2017, Stanza living offers accommodation to students with prices ranging from ₹7,000 to ₹25,000 per student.","New Delhi-based student accommodation platform Stanza Living has raised $2 Mn in funding from investment firms Matrix Partners and California-headquartered Accel Partners. The startup will be utilising the fresh capital to expand its presence in new cities and further develop its technology platform. A portion of the funding will also be spent on talent acquisition. Stanza Living's approach to creating a home away from home for students, is a compelling value proposition that we expect will see rapid adoption from parents and students across the country. As stated by Stanza Living co-founder Anindya Dutta, the company is looking to extend its geographical reach beyond Delhi/NCR to other educational hubs across the country. In the next two years, the startup is aiming to increase the number of students on its platform from the current 100 to over 5,000. Dutta added, We are currently building another 300 housing spaces focused on students. Founded in the early part of 2017 by former Boston Consulting Group executive Sandeep Dalmia and Anindya Dutta, Stanza Living is a technology-enabled student accommodation concept that puts the student as a consumer at the heart of its product and service design. Using the Stanza Living platform, students can find accommodation with prices ranging from $108.7 to $388.2. In addition to offering accommodation facilities, the startup specialises in student well-being programmes. For instance, it provides community networking and internship opportunities to students through its Stanza Social initiative. The programme, which organises monthly networking events with startups and bigger firms, is aimed at ensuring a student's well-being and all-round development. Another programme offered by the platform is Stanza Springboard, which focusses on the professional growth and development of students. As part of this initiative, the company provides counselling sessions, internship opportunities with different companies as well as interactive sessions with startup founders and other industry professionals. The country's student accommodation sector, Dutta claims, is largely disorganised and fragmented. Armed with the newly-raised financing from Matrix Partners and Accel, Stanza Living is looking to redefine student living experiences. A spokesperson from the company stated, It amazes us as to how an industry that generates annual revenues in excess of $14 Bn continues to see no fundamental innovations and disruption. We, at Stanza, see a massive disruption opportunity in this industry. We believe we could create a powerful youth brand that could organize the student accommodation market in ways similar to how the Hiltons and Marriotts of the world transformed the hospitality space. Other startups in the accommodation aggregator space include Bengaluru-based home rental platform Nestaway, Homigo, Zocalo, Gurugram-based Fella Homes and NoBroker.",https://inc42.com/buzz/stanza-living-matrix-accel-funding/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly

This indicates a strong adherence and habituation. The company also conducts virtual fitness events. Gul Panag added, With the launch of its paid programmes six months ago, Mobiefit became the first fitness app from India to offer training programs via in-app subscriptions. Its growth is driven by the competitive pricing which is a fraction of the cost of traditional means like gyms and fitness trainers. Prior to the latest investment from MediAssist and NB Ventures, MobieFit had secured around $1 Mn Seed funding in a round led by MediAssist, with participation from angel investors - Paragon Partners founder Siddharth Parekh and Mahesh Murthy of Seedfund. At the time, Jaswal had stated, With our partnership with MediAssist, we hope to take our mFitness offering to more than 5 Mn corporate employees in urban India. The fitness industry in the country is home to more than 120 startups that have collectively raised over $21.2 Mn in funding during FY17. In June 2017, Mumbai-headquartered Growfitter raised $600K in a Pre-Series A round from SQue Capital. A month later in August, Bengaluru-based health and wellness startup CureFit reportedly signed on Hrithik Roshan as its brand ambassador, as part of a five-year contract valued at $15.6 Mn.

The company aims to be profitable by FY 2019 riding on its strategies such as third-party delivery logistics through Dash, food recommendation and discovery through the revamped India app, bringing Shahrukh Khan as the face of the brand and working on food quality initiatives such as the Food Doctor Program. We are rigorously moving towards strengthening our technology and delivery services in cognizance of the $50 Bn worth of food services industry in the country.

Foodpanda India is majorly focused on pure delivery in comparison to its incumbents who are also testing waters in the cloud kitchen space. So far, the financials are showing positive indications for the online food delivery service. However, with growing number of heavy war-chest players and the Indian consumer becoming more and more adaptive to new age technologies as well as innovations, let's see if foodpanda will also be prompted to change its course in near future.",https://inc42.com/buzz/food-delivery-foodpanda-india-revenue/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
100,Amazon India reports over 105% revenue growth in FY17,"Amazon on Wednesday said that it has more than doubled its business in Indian subsidiary, Amazon Seller Services, with over 105% growth in revenues in the year ended March. The subsidiary posted a 41% increase in earning to $485.4 million during the said period, according to filings. Earlier, Amazon invested over ₹2,900 crore into Amazon Seller Services, as per filings.","At a time when Flipkart's valuation has been marked up by one of its investors Morgan Stanley, the Indian arm of global ecommerce behemoth Amazon has reported over 105% growth in revenue in FY17. As per filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Amazon Seller Services posted a 41% increase in earning to $485.4 Mn during the said period. Amazon Seller Services currently earns through commissions, advertisements and shipping fees. Recently, in the third week of November, Amazon India issued paid-up capital of $2.7 Bn towards its marketplace arm Amazon Seller Services, as per its regulatory filings. The Annual Returns filings include other line items. In addition to earnings from the marketplace and seller commissions, Amazon India currently generates revenue from its Seattle-headquartered parent by way of advertising fees, royalty on sales of Amazon's in-house brands like Kindle and other transactions. As per industry experts, the ecommerce giant's impressive growth can be attributed, in part, to demonetisation which was instituted in November 2016. Speaking on the matter, an online seller on Amazon requesting anonymity said, Last fiscal, the impact on Amazon was across categories -smartphones to electronics to apparel. These are the largest selling and fastest growing segments in e-commerce. According to some, however, Amazon's growth in sales slowed down considerably after the Indian government's Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) cautioned online marketplaces against deep discounting in April 2016. A report by Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Research, for instance, states that the online sales of smartphones and other gadgets stagnated last fiscal after a three-year period of steady growth. Online smartphone sales increase merely by one percent to 32% in 2016, which the study ascribed to demonetisation, lower discounts and uniform pricing across online and offline platforms. Another factor that has contributed to the slowdown pertains to the new FDI guidelines issued by the DIPP last year. Formalised in March 2016, the stricter guidelines on ecommerce dictate: An ecommerce entity would not permit more than 25% of the sales effected through its marketplace from one vendor or their group companies. Ecommerce entities providing marketplace would not directly or indirectly influence the sale price of goods or services and shall maintain level playing field. Consequently, Amazon India's biggest seller Cloudtail stopped the sale of mobile phones on its platform in September 2016. Prior to that, smartphones contributed towards a significant portion of Cloudtail's revenues. As per the earning report posted recently, Cloudtail recorded a 24% jump in its revenue for FY17, showcasing a net revenue of $883.1 Mn. However, this is significantly less compared to the 300% surge to $712 Mn the vendor reported in FY16. Cloudtail currently competes with Flipkart's biggest vendor WS Retail, which posted a net revenue of $2.16 Bn in 2016. The financial report for FY17 has not yet been filed by Flipkart. Most recently, with the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in April 2017, Amazon India also had to suspend its invite-only Platinum Seller Program (PSP). While changing regulations are making it more difficult for ecommerce platforms to sustain business growth, Amazon remains focussed on its aim to capture the Indian market. To that end, the online marketplace recently doubled its authorized capital to $4.74 Bn, matching its earlier capital commitment of $5 Bn made in June last year. With the goal of getting ahead of rival Flipkart, the company is also doubling down on its efforts to diversify its business. On the one hand, it is getting ready to enter the online food retail and grocery market, while on the other hand, it is eyeing a piece of the Indian digital payments pie with Amazon Pay. The strategy seems to be working, given that it clocked over 105% growth in FY17.",https://inc42.com/buzz/amazon-india-revenue/?utm_campaign=awesummly&utm_source=awesummly
